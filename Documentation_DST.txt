As mentioned in Theory.html, although calendrical issues are out of										
scope for tzdb, they indicate the sort of problems that we would run										
into if we extended tzdb further into the past.  The following										
information and sources go beyond Theory.html's brief discussion.										
They sometimes disagree.										
										
										
France										
										
Gregorian calendar adopted 1582-12-20.										
French Revolutionary calendar used 1793-11-24 through 1805-12-31,										
and (in Paris only) 1871-05-06 through 1871-05-23.										
										
										
Russia										
										
From Chris Carrier (1996-12-02):										
"On 1929-10-01 the Soviet Union instituted an ""Eternal Calendar"""										
with 30-day months plus 5 holidays, with a 5-day week.										
"On 1931-12-01 it changed to a 6-day week; in 1934 it reverted to the"										
"Gregorian calendar while retaining the 6-day week; on 1940-06-27 it"										
reverted to the 7-day week.  With the 6-day week the usual days										
off were the 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th and 30th of the month.

If your source is correct, how come documents between 1929 and 1940 were										
still dated using the conventional, Gregorian calendar?										
										
I can post a scan of a document dated December 1, 1934, signed by										
Yenukidze, the secretary, on behalf of Kalinin, the President of the										
Executive Committee of the Supreme Soviet, if you like.

In 1700, Denmark made the transition from Julian to Gregorian.  Sweden										
decided to *start* a transition in 1700 as well, but rather than have one of										
those unsightly calendar gaps :-), they simply decreed that the next leap										
year after 1696 would be in 1744 - putting the whole country on a calendar										
different from both Julian and Gregorian for a period of 40 years.										
										
"However, in 1704 something went wrong and the plan was not carried through;"										
they did, after all, have a leap year that year.  And one in 1708.  In 1712										
they gave it up and went back to Julian, putting 30 days in February that										
year!...										
										
Then in 1753, Sweden made the transition to Gregorian in the usual manner,										
getting there only 13 years behind the original schedule.										
										
(A previous posting of this story was challenged, and Swedish readers										
"produced the following references to support it: ""Tideräkning och historia"""										
"by Natanael Beckman (1924) and ""Tid, en bok om tideräkning och"										
"kalenderväsen"" by Lars-Olof Lodén (1968)."

The time zone database is by no means authoritative: governments										
change timekeeping rules erratically and sometimes with little										
warning, the data entries do not cover all of civil time before										
1970, and undoubtedly errors remain in the code and data.  Feel										
free to fill gaps or fix mistakes, and please email improvements										
to tz@iana.org for use in the future.  In your email, please give										
reliable sources that reviewers can check.										
										
-----										
										
Developers can contribute technical changes to the source code and										
data as follows.										
										
To email small changes, please run a POSIX shell command like										
'diff -u old/europe new/europe >myfix.patch', and attach										
myfix.patch to the email.										
										
For more-elaborate changes, please read the theory.html file and browse										
the mailing list archives <https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/> for										
examples of patches that tend to work well.  Additions to										
data should contain commentary citing reliable sources as										
justification.  Citations should use https: URLs if available.										
										
Please submit changes against either the latest release in										
<https://www.iana.org/time-zones> or the master branch of the development										
repository.  If you use Git the following workflow may be helpful:										
										
  * Copy the development repository.										
										
      git clone https://github.com/eggert/tz.git										
      cd tz										
										
  * Get current with the master branch.										
										
      git checkout master										
      git pull										
										
  * Switch to a new branch for the changes.  Choose a different										
    branch name for each change set.										
										
      git checkout -b mybranch										
										
  * Edit source files.  Include commentary that justifies the										
    changes by citing reliable sources.										
										
  * Debug the changes, e.g.:										
										
      make check										
      make install										
      ./zdump -v America/Los_Angeles										
										
  * For each separable change, commit it in the new branch, e.g.:										
										
      git add northamerica										
      git commit										
										
    See recent 'git log' output for the commit-message style.										
										
  * Create patch files 0001-*, 0002-*, ...										
										
      git format-patch master										
										
  * After reviewing the patch files, send the patches to tz@iana.org										
    for others to review.										
										
      git send-email master										
										
  * Start anew by getting current with the master branch again										
    (the second step above).										
										
Please do not create issues or pull requests on GitHub, as the										
proper procedure for proposing and distributing patches is via										
email as illustrated above.

Release 2017c - 2017-10-20 14:49:34 -0700										
										
  Briefly:										
  Northern Cyprus switches from +03 to +02/+03 on 2017-10-29.										
  Fiji ends DST 2018-01-14, not 2018-01-21.										
  Namibia switches from +01/+02 to +02 on 2018-04-01.										
  Sudan switches from +03 to +02 on 2017-11-01.										
  Tonga likely switches from +13/+14 to +13 on 2017-11-05.										
  Turks & Caicos switches from -04 to -05/-04 on 2018-11-04.										
  A new file tzdata.zi now holds a small text copy of all data.										
  The zic input format has been regularized slightly.										
										
  Changes to future time stamps										
										
    Northern Cyprus has decided to resume EU rules starting										
    2017-10-29, thus reinstituting winter time.										
										
    Fiji ends DST 2018-01-14 instead of the 2018-01-21 previously										
    predicted.  (Thanks to Dominic Fok.)  Adjust future predictions										
    accordingly.										
										
    Namibia will switch from +01 with DST to +02 all year on										
    2017-09-03 at 02:00.  This affects UT offsets starting 2018-04-01										
    at 02:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
    Sudan will switch from +03 to +02 on 2017-11-01.  (Thanks to Ahmed										
    Atyya and Yahia Abdalla.)  South Sudan is not switching, so										
    Africa/Juba is no longer a link to Africa/Khartoum.										
										
    Tonga has likely ended its experiment with DST, and will not										
    adjust its clocks on 2017-11-05.  Although Tonga has not announced										
    whether it will continue to observe DST, the IATA is assuming that										
    it will not.  (Thanks to David Wade.)										
										
    Turks & Caicos will switch from -04 all year to -05 with US DST on										
    2018-03-11 at 03:00.  This affects UT offsets starting 2018-11-04										
    at 02:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
  Changes to past time stamps										
										
    Namibia switched from +02 to +01 on 1994-03-21, not 1994-04-03.										
    (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)										
										
    Detroit did not observe DST in 1967.										
										
    Use railway time for Asia/Kolkata before 1941, by switching to										
    Madras local time (UT +052110) in 1870, then to IST (UT +0530) in										
    1906.  Also, treat 1941-2's +0630 as DST, like 1942-5.										
										
    Europe/Dublin's 1946 and 1947 fallback transitions occurred at										
    02:00 standard time, not 02:00 DST.  (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)										
										
    Pacific/Apia and Pacific/Pago_Pago switched from Antipodean to										
    American time in 1892, not 1879.  (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)										
										
    Adjust the 1867 transition in Alaska to better reflect the										
    historical record, by changing it to occur on 1867-10-18 at 15:30										
    Sitka time rather than at the start of 1867-10-17 local time.										
    Although strictly speaking this is accurate only for Sitka,										
    the rest of Alaska's blanks need to be filled in somehow.										
										
    Fix off-by-one errors in UT offsets for Adak and Nome before 1867.										
    (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)										
										
    Add 7 s to the UT offset in Asia/Yangon before 1920.										
										
  Changes to zone names										
										
    Remove Canada/East-Saskatchewan from the 'backward' file, as it										
    exceeded the 14-character limit and was an unused misnomer anyway.										
										
  Changes to build procedure										
										
    To support applications that prefer to read time zone data in text										
    form, two zic input files tzdata.zi and leapseconds are now										
    installed by default.  The commands 'zic tzdata.zi' and 'zic -L										
    leapseconds tzdata.zi' can reproduce the tzdata binary files										
    without and with leap seconds, respectively.  To prevent these two										
    new files from being installed, use 'make TZDATA_TEXT=', and to										
    suppress leap seconds from the tzdata text installation, use 'make										
    TZDATA_TEXT=tzdata.zi'.										
										
    'make BACKWARD=' now suppresses backward-compatibility names										
    like 'US/Pacific' that are defined in the 'backward' and										
    'pacificnew' files.										
										
    'make check' now works on systems that lack a UTF-8 locale,										
    or that lack the nsgmls program.  Set UTF8_LOCALE to configure										
    the name of a UTF-8 locale, if you have one.										
										
    Y2K runtime checks are no longer enabled by default.  Add										
    -DDEPRECATE_TWO_DIGIT_YEARS to CFLAGS to enable them, instead of										
    adding -DNO_RUN_TIME_WARNINGS_ABOUT_YEAR_2000_PROBLEMS_THANK_YOU										
    to disable them.  (New name suggested by Brian Inglis.)										
										
    The build procedure for zdump now works on AIX 7.1.										
    (Problem reported by Kees Dekker.)										
										
  Changes to code										
										
    zic and the reference runtime now reject multiple leap seconds										
    within 28 days of each other, or leap seconds before the Epoch.										
    As a result, support for double leap seconds, which was										
    obsolescent and undocumented, has been removed.  Double leap										
"    seconds were an error in the C89 standard; they have never existed"										
    in civil timekeeping.  (Thanks to Robert Elz and Bradley White for										
    noticing glitches in the code that uncovered this problem.)										
										
    zic now warns about use of the obsolescent and undocumented -y										
    option, and about use of the obsolescent TYPE field of Rule lines.										
										
"    zic now allows unambiguous abbreviations like ""Sa"" and ""Su"" for"										
"    weekdays; formerly it rejected them due to a bug.  Conversely, zic"										
"    no longer considers non-prefixes to be abbreviations; for example,"										
"    it no longer accepts ""lF"" as an abbreviation for ""lastFriday""."										
"    Also, zic warns about the undocumented usage with a ""last-"""										
"    prefix, e.g., ""last-Fri""."										
										
"    Similarly, zic now accepts the unambiguous abbreviation ""L"" for"										
"    ""Link"" in ordinary context and for ""Leap"" in leap-second context."										
"    Conversely, zic no longer accepts non-prefixes such as ""La"" as"										
"    abbreviations for words like ""Leap""."										
										
    zic no longer accepts leap second lines in ordinary input, or										
    ordinary lines in leap second input.  Formerly, zic sometimes										
    warned about this undocumented usage and handled it incorrectly.										
										
    The new macro HAVE_TZNAME governs whether the tzname external										
    variable is exported, instead of USG_COMPAT.  USG_COMPAT now										
"    governs only the external variables ""timezone"" and ""daylight""."										
    This change is needed because the three variables are not in the										
    same category: although POSIX requires tzname, it specifies the										
    other two variables as optional.  Also, USG_COMPAT is now 1 or 0:										
    if not defined, the code attempts to guess it from other macros.										
										
    localtime.c and difftime.c no longer require stdio.h, and .c files										
    other than zic.c no longer require sys/wait.h.										
										
    zdump.c no longer assumes snprintf.  (Reported by Jonathan Leffler.)										
										
    Calculation of time_t extrema works around a bug in GCC 4.8.4										
    (Reported by Stan Shebs and Joseph Myers.)										
										
    zic.c no longer mistranslates formats of line numbers in non-English										
    locales.  (Problem reported by Benno Schulenberg.)										
										
    Several minor changes have been made to the code to make it a										
    bit easier to port to MS-Windows and Solaris.  (Thanks to Kees										
    Dekker for reporting the problems.)										
										
  Changes to documentation and commentary										
										
    The two new files 'theory.html' and 'calendars' contain the										
    contents of the removed file 'Theory'.  The goal is to document										
    tzdb theory more accessibly.										
										
    The zic man page now documents abbreviation rules.										
										
    tz-link.htm now covers how to apply tzdata changes to clients.										
    (Thanks to Jorge Fábregas for the AIX link.)  It also mentions MySQL.										
										
    The leap-seconds.list URL has been updated to something that is										
    more reliable for tzdb.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti and Brian Inglis.)										
										
Release 2017b - 2017-03-17 07:30:38 -0700										
										
  Briefly: Haiti has resumed DST.										
										
  Changes to past and future time stamps										
										
    Haiti resumed observance of DST in 2017.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
  Changes to past time stamps										
										
    Liberia changed from -004430 to +00 on 1972-01-07, not 1972-05-01.										
										
"    Use ""MMT"" to abbreviate Liberia's time zone before 1972, as ""-004430"""										
    is one byte over the POSIX limit.  (Problem reported by Derick Rethans.)										
										
  Changes to code										
										
    The reference localtime implementation now falls back on the										
    current US daylight-saving transition rules rather than the										
    1987-2006 rules.  This fallback occurs only when (1) the TZ										
"    environment variable's value has a name like ""AST4ADT"" that asks"										
    for daylight saving time but does not specify the rules, (2) there										
    is no file by that name, and (3) the TZDEFRULES file cannot be										
    loaded.  (Thanks to Tom Lane.)										
										
										
Release 2017a - 2017-02-28 00:05:36 -0800										
										
  Briefly: Southern Chile moves from -04/-03 to -03, and Mongolia										
  discontinues DST.										
										
  Changes to future time stamps										
										
    Mongolia no longer observes DST.  (Thanks to Ganbold Tsagaankhuu.)										
										
    Chile's Region of Magallanes moves from -04/-03 to -03 year-round.										
    Its clocks diverge from America/Santiago starting 2017-05-13 at										
    23:00, hiving off a new zone America/Punta_Arenas.  Although the										
    Chilean government says this change expires in May 2019, for now										
    assume it's permanent.  (Thanks to Juan Correa and Deborah										
    Goldsmith.)  This also affects Antarctica/Palmer.										
										
  Changes to past time stamps										
										
    Fix many entries for historical time stamps for Europe/Madrid										
    before 1979, to agree with tables compiled by Pere Planesas of the										
    National Astronomical Observatory of Spain.  As a side effect,										
    this changes some time stamps for Africa/Ceuta before 1929, which										
    are probably guesswork anyway.  (Thanks to Steve Allen and										
    Pierpaolo Bernardi for the heads-ups, and to Michael Deckers for										
    correcting the 1901 transition.)										
										
    Ecuador observed DST from 1992-11-28 to 1993-02-05.										
    (Thanks to Alois Treindl.)										
										
    Asia/Atyrau and Asia/Oral were at +03 (not +04) before 1930-06-21.										
    (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)										
										
  Changes to past and future time zone abbreviations										
										
    Switch to numeric time zone abbreviations for South America, as										
    part of the ongoing project of removing invented abbreviations.										
    This avoids the need to invent an abbreviation for the new Chilean										
    new zone.  Similarly, switch from invented to numeric time zone										
    abbreviations for Afghanistan, American Samoa, the Azores,										
    Bangladesh, Bhutan, the British Indian Ocean Territory, Brunei,										
    Cape Verde, Chatham Is, Christmas I, Cocos (Keeling) Is, Cook Is,										
    Dubai, East Timor, Eucla, Fiji, French Polynesia, Greenland,										
    Indochina, Iran, Iraq, Kiribati, Lord Howe, Macquarie, Malaysia,										
    the Maldives, Marshall Is, Mauritius, Micronesia, Mongolia,										
    Myanmar, Nauru, Nepal, New Caledonia, Niue, Norfolk I, Palau,										
    Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Pitcairn, Qatar, Réunion, St										
    Pierre & Miquelon, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, Singapore,										
    Solomon Is, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Wake, Vanuatu, Wallis & Futuna, and										
"    Xinjiang; for 20-minute daylight saving time in Ghana before 1943;"										
    for half-hour daylight saving time in Belize before 1944 and in										
"    the Dominican Republic before 1975; and for Canary Islands before"										
    1946, for Guinea-Bissau before 1975, for Iceland before 1969, for										
    Indian Summer Time before 1942, for Indonesia before around 1964,										
    for Kenya before 1960, for Liberia before 1973, for Madeira before										
    1967, for Namibia before 1943, for the Netherlands in 1937-9, for										
    Pakistan before 1971, for Western Sahara before 1977, and for										
    Zaporozhye in 1880-1924.										
										
"    For Alaska time from 1900 through 1967, instead of ""CAT"" use the"										
"    abbreviation ""AST"", the abbreviation commonly used at the time"										
"    (Atlantic Standard Time had not been standardized yet).  Use ""AWT"""										
"    and ""APT"" instead of the invented abbreviations ""CAWT"" and ""CAPT""."										
										
"    Use ""CST"" and ""CDT"" instead of invented abbreviations for Macau"										
"    before 1999 and Taiwan before 1938, and use ""JST"" instead of the"										
"    invented abbreviation ""JCST"" for Japan and Korea before 1938."										
										
  Change to database entry category										
										
    Move the Pacific/Johnston link from 'australasia' to 'backward',										
    since Johnston is now uninhabited.										
										
  Changes to code										
										
    zic no longer mishandles some transitions in January 2038 when it										
    attempts to work around Qt bug 53071.  This fixes a bug affecting										
    Pacific/Tongatapu that was introduced in zic 2016e.  localtime.c										
    now contains a workaround, useful when loading a file generated by										
    a buggy zic.  (Problem and localtime.c fix reported by Bradley										
    White.)										
										
    zdump -i now outputs non-hour numeric time zone abbreviations										
"    without a colon, e.g., ""+0530"" rather than ""+05:30"".  This agrees"										
    with zic %z and with common practice, and simplifies auditing of										
    zdump output.										
										
    zdump is now buildable again with -DUSE_LTZ=0.										
    (Problem reported by Joseph Myers.)										
										
    zdump.c now always includes private.h, to avoid code duplication										
    with private.h.  (Problem reported by Kees Dekker.)										
										
    localtime.c no longer mishandles early or late timestamps										
    when TZ is set to a POSIX-style string that specifies DST.										
    (Problem reported by Kees Dekker.)										
										
"    date and strftime now cause %z to generate ""-0000"" instead of"										
"    ""+0000"" when the UT offset is zero and the time zone abbreviation"										
"    begins with ""-""."										
										
  Changes to documentation and commentary										
										
    The 'Theory' file now better documents choice of historical time										
    zone abbreviations.  (Problems reported by Michael Deckers.)										
										
    tz-link.htm now covers leap smearing, which is popular in clouds.										
										
										
Release 2016j - 2016-11-22 23:17:13 -0800										
										
  Briefly: Saratov, Russia moves from +03 to +04 on 2016-12-04.										
										
  Changes to future time stamps										
										
    Saratov, Russia switches from +03 to +04 on 2016-12-04 at 02:00.										
    This hives off a new zone Europe/Saratov from Europe/Volgograd.										
    (Thanks to Yuri Konotopov and Stepan Golosunov.)										
										
  Changes to past time stamps										
										
    The new zone Asia/Atyrau for Atyraū Region, Kazakhstan, is like										
    Asia/Aqtau except it switched from +05/+06 to +04/+05 in spring										
    1999, not fall 1994.  (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)										
										
  Changes to past time zone abbreviations										
										
"    Asia/Gaza and Asia/Hebron now use ""EEST"", not ""EET"", to denote"										
"    summer time before 1948.  The old use of ""EET"" was a typo."										
										
  Changes to code										
										
    zic no longer mishandles file systems that lack hard links, fixing										
    bugs introduced in 2016g.  (Problems reported by Tom Lane.)										
    Also, when the destination already contains symbolic links, zic										
    should now work better on systems where the 'link' system call										
    does not follow symbolic links.										
										
  Changes to documentation and commentary										
										
    tz-link.htm now documents the relationship between release version										
    numbers and development-repository commit tags.  (Suggested by										
    Paul Koning.)										
										
    The 'Theory' file now documents UT.										
										
"    iso3166.tab now accents ""Curaçao"", and commentary now mentions"										
"    the names ""Cabo Verde"" and ""Czechia"".  (Thanks to Jiří Boháč.)"										
										
										
Release 2016i - 2016-11-01 23:19:52 -0700										
										
  Briefly: Cyprus split into two time zones on 2016-10-30, and Tonga										
  reintroduces DST on 2016-11-06.										
										
  Changes to future time stamps										
										
    Pacific/Tongatapu begins DST on 2016-11-06 at 02:00, ending on										
    2017-01-15 at 03:00.  Assume future observances in Tonga will be										
    from the first Sunday in November through the third Sunday in										
    January, like Fiji.  (Thanks to Pulu ʻAnau.)  Switch to numeric										
    time zone abbreviations for this zone.										
										
  Changes to past and future time stamps										
										
    Northern Cyprus is now +03 year round, causing a split in Cyprus										
    time zones starting 2016-10-30 at 04:00.  This creates a zone										
    Asia/Famagusta.  (Thanks to Even Scharning and Matt Johnson.)										
										
    Antarctica/Casey switched from +08 to +11 on 2016-10-22.										
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
  Changes to past time stamps										
										
    Several corrections were made for pre-1975 time stamps in Italy.										
    These affect Europe/Malta, Europe/Rome, Europe/San_Marino, and										
    Europe/Vatican.										
										
    First, the 1893-11-01 00:00 transition in Italy used the new UT										
    offset (+01), not the old (+00:49:56).  (Thanks to Michael										
    Deckers.)										
										
    Second, rules for daylight saving in Italy were changed to agree										
    with Italy's National Institute of Metrological Research (INRiM)										
    except for 1944, as follows (thanks to Pierpaolo Bernardi, Brian										
    Inglis, and Michael Deckers):										
										
      The 1916-06-03 transition was at 24:00, not 00:00.										
										
      The 1916-10-01, 1919-10-05, and 1920-09-19 transitions were at										
      00:00, not 01:00.										
										
      The 1917-09-30 and 1918-10-06 transitions were at 24:00, not										
      01:00.										
										
      The 1944-09-17 transition was at 03:00, not 01:00.  This										
      particular change is taken from Italian law as INRiM's table,										
      (which says 02:00) appears to have a typo here.  Also, keep the										
      1944-04-03 transition for Europe/Rome, as Rome was controlled by										
      Germany then.										
										
      The 1967-1970 and 1972-1974 fallback transitions were at 01:00,										
      not 00:00.										
										
  Changes to code										
										
    The code should now be buildable on AmigaOS merely by setting the										
    appropriate Makefile variables.  (From a patch by Carsten Larsen.)										
										
										
Release 2016h - 2016-10-19 23:17:57 -0700										
										
  Changes to future time stamps										
										
    Asia/Gaza and Asia/Hebron end DST on 2016-10-29 at 01:00, not										
    2016-10-21 at 00:00.  (Thanks to Sharef Mustafa.)  Predict that										
    future fall transitions will be on the last Saturday of October										
    at 01:00, which is consistent with predicted spring transitions										
    on the last Saturday of March.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)										
										
  Changes to past time stamps										
										
    In Turkey, transitions in 1986-1990 were at 01:00 standard time										
    not at 02:00, and the spring 1994 transition was on March 20, not										
    March 27.  (Thanks to Kıvanç Yazan.)										
										
  Changes to past and future time zone abbreviations										
										
"    Asia/Colombo now uses numeric time zone abbreviations like ""+0530"""										
"    instead of alphabetic ones like ""IST"" and ""LKT"".  Various"										
"    English-language sources use ""IST"", ""LKT"" and ""SLST"", with no"										
"    working consensus.  (Usage of ""SLST"" mentioned by Sadika"										
    Sumanapala.)										
										
  Changes to code										
										
    zic no longer mishandles relativizing file names when creating										
    symbolic links like /etc/localtime, when these symbolic links										
    are outside the usual directory hierarchy.  This fixes a bug										
    introduced in 2016g.  (Problem reported by Andreas Stieger.)										
										
  Changes to build procedure										
										
    New rules 'traditional_tarballs' and 'traditional_signatures' for										
    building just the traditional-format distribution.  (Requested by										
    Deborah Goldsmith.)										
										
    The file 'version' is now put into the tzdata tarball too.										
    (Requested by Howard Hinnant.)										
										
  Changes to documentation and commentary										
										
    The 'Theory' file now has a section on interface stability.										
    (Requested by Paul Koning.)  It also mentions features like										
    tm_zone and localtime_rz that have long been supported by the										
    reference code.										
										
    tz-link.htm has improved coverage of time zone boundaries suitable										
    for geolocation.  (Thanks to heads-ups from Evan Siroky and Matt										
    Johnson.)										
										
"    The US commentary now mentions Allen and the ""day of two noons""."										
										
    The Fiji commentary mentions the government's 2016-10-03 press										
    release.  (Thanks to Raymond Kumar.)										
										
										
Release 2016g - 2016-09-13 08:56:38 -0700										
										
  Changes to future time stamps										
										
    Turkey switched from EET/EEST (+02/+03) to permanent +03,										
"    effective 2016-09-07.  (Thanks to Burak AYDIN.)  Use ""+03"" rather"										
    than an invented abbreviation for the new time.										
										
    New leap second 2016-12-31 23:59:60 UTC as per IERS Bulletin C 52.										
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)										
										
  Changes to past time stamps										
										
    For America/Los_Angeles, spring-forward transition times have been										
    corrected from 02:00 to 02:01 in 1948, and from 02:00 to 01:00 in										
    1950-1966.										
										
    For zones using Soviet time on 1919-07-01, transitions to UT-based										
    time were at 00:00 UT, not at 02:00 local time.  The affected										
    zones are Europe/Kirov, Europe/Moscow, Europe/Samara, and										
    Europe/Ulyanovsk.  (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky.)										
										
  Changes to past and future time zone abbreviations										
										
    The Factory zone now uses the time zone abbreviation -00 instead										
    of a long English-language string, as -00 is now the normal way to										
    represent an undefined time zone.										
										
    Several zones in Antarctica and the former Soviet Union, along										
    with zones intended for ships at sea that cannot use POSIX TZ										
    strings, now use numeric time zone abbreviations instead of										
    invented or obsolete alphanumeric abbreviations.  The affected										
    zones are Antarctica/Casey, Antarctica/Davis,										
    Antarctica/DumontDUrville, Antarctica/Mawson, Antarctica/Rothera,										
    Antarctica/Syowa, Antarctica/Troll, Antarctica/Vostok,										
    Asia/Anadyr, Asia/Ashgabat, Asia/Baku, Asia/Bishkek, Asia/Chita,										
    Asia/Dushanbe, Asia/Irkutsk, Asia/Kamchatka, Asia/Khandyga,										
    Asia/Krasnoyarsk, Asia/Magadan, Asia/Omsk, Asia/Sakhalin,										
    Asia/Samarkand, Asia/Srednekolymsk, Asia/Tashkent, Asia/Tbilisi,										
    Asia/Ust-Nera, Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Yakutsk, Asia/Yekaterinburg,										
    Asia/Yerevan, Etc/GMT-14, Etc/GMT-13, Etc/GMT-12, Etc/GMT-11,										
    Etc/GMT-10, Etc/GMT-9, Etc/GMT-8, Etc/GMT-7, Etc/GMT-6, Etc/GMT-5,										
    Etc/GMT-4, Etc/GMT-3, Etc/GMT-2, Etc/GMT-1, Etc/GMT+1, Etc/GMT+2,										
    Etc/GMT+3, Etc/GMT+4, Etc/GMT+5, Etc/GMT+6, Etc/GMT+7, Etc/GMT+8,										
    Etc/GMT+9, Etc/GMT+10, Etc/GMT+11, Etc/GMT+12, Europe/Kaliningrad,										
    Europe/Minsk, Europe/Samara, Europe/Volgograd, and										
    Indian/Kerguelen.  For Europe/Moscow the invented abbreviation MSM										
    was replaced by +05, whereas MSK and MSD were kept as they are not										
    our invention and are widely used.										
										
  Changes to zone names										
										
    Rename Asia/Rangoon to Asia/Yangon, with a backward compatibility link.										
    (Thanks to David Massoud.)										
										
  Changes to code										
										
    zic no longer generates binary files containing POSIX TZ-like										
    strings that disagree with the local time type after the last										
    explicit transition in the data.  This fixes a bug with										
    Africa/Casablanca and Africa/El_Aaiun in some year-2037 time										
    stamps on the reference platform.  (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky										
    for reporting the bug and suggesting a way forward.)										
										
    If the installed localtime and/or posixrules files are symbolic										
    links, zic now keeps them symbolic links when updating them, for										
    compatibility with platforms like OpenSUSE where other programs										
    configure these files as symlinks.										
										
    zic now avoids hard linking to symbolic links, avoids some										
    unnecessary mkdir and stat system calls, and uses shorter file										
    names internally.										
										
    zdump has a new -i option to generate transitions in a										
    more-compact but still human-readable format.  This option is										
    experimental, and the output format may change in future versions.										
    (Thanks to Jon Skeet for suggesting that an option was needed,										
    and thanks to Tim Parenti and Chris Rovick for further comments.)										
										
  Changes to build procedure										
										
    An experimental distribution format is available, in addition										
    to the traditional format which will continue to be distributed.										
    The new format is a tarball tzdb-VERSION.tar.lz with signature										
    file tzdb-VERSION.tar.lz.asc.  It unpacks to a top-level directory										
    tzdb-VERSION containing the code and data of the traditional										
    two-tarball format, along with extra data that may be useful.										
    (Thanks to Antonio Diaz Diaz, Oscar van Vlijmen, and many others										
    for comments about the experimental format.)										
										
    The release version number is now more accurate in the usual case										
    where releases are built from a Git repository.  For example, if										
    23 commits and some working-file changes have been made since										
    release 2016g, the version number is now something like										
    '2016g-23-g50556e3-dirty' instead of the misleading '2016g'.										
    Tagged releases use the same version number format as before,										
    e.g., '2016g'.  To support the more-accurate version number, its										
    specification has moved from a line in the Makefile to a new										
    source file 'version'.										
										
    The experimental distribution contains a file to2050.tzs that										
    contains what should be the output of 'zdump -i -c 2050' on										
    primary zones.  If this file is available, 'make check' now checks										
    that zdump generates this output.										
										
    'make check_web' now works on Fedora-like distributions.										
										
  Changes to documentation and commentary										
										
    tzfile.5 now documents the new restriction on POSIX TZ-like										
    strings that is now implemented by zic.										
										
    Comments now cite URLs for some 1917-1921 Russian DST decrees.										
    (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky.)										
										
    tz-link.htm mentions JuliaTime (thanks to Curtis Vogt) and Time4J										
    (thanks to Meno Hochschild) and ThreeTen-Extra, and its										
    description of Java 8 has been brought up to date (thanks to										
    Stephen Colebourne).  Its description of local time on Mars has										
    been updated to match current practice, and URLs have been updated										
    and some obsolete ones removed.

  Changes affecting future time stamps										
										
    The Egyptian government changed its mind on short notice, and										
    Africa/Cairo will not introduce DST starting 2016-07-07 after all.										
    (Thanks to Mina Samuel.)										
										
    Asia/Novosibirsk switches from +06 to +07 on 2016-07-24 at 02:00.										
    (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)										
										
  Changes to past and future time stamps										
										
    Asia/Novokuznetsk and Asia/Novosibirsk now use numeric time zone										
    abbreviations instead of invented ones.										
										
  Changes affecting past time stamps										
										
    Europe/Minsk's 1992-03-29 spring-forward transition was at 02:00 not 00:00.										
    (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)										
										
										
Release 2016e - 2016-06-14 08:46:16 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting future time stamps										
										
    Africa/Cairo observes DST in 2016 from July 7 to the end of October.										
    Guess October 27 and 24:00 transitions.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
    For future years, guess April's last Thursday to October's last										
    Thursday except for Ramadan.										
										
  Changes affecting past time stamps										
										
    Locations while uninhabited now use '-00', not 'zzz', as a										
    placeholder time zone abbreviation.  This is inspired by Internet										
    RFC 3339 and is more consistent with numeric time zone										
    abbreviations already used elsewhere.  The change affects several										
    arctic and antarctic locations, e.g., America/Cambridge_Bay before										
    1920 and Antarctica/Troll before 2005.										
										
    Asia/Baku's 1992-09-27 transition from +04 (DST) to +04 (non-DST) was										
    at 03:00, not 23:00 the previous day.  (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)										
										
  Changes to code										
										
    zic now outputs a dummy transition at time 2**31 - 1 in zones										
    whose POSIX-style TZ strings contain a '<'.  This mostly works										
    around Qt bug 53071 <https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-53071>.										
    (Thanks to Zhanibek Adilbekov for reporting the Qt bug.)										
										
  Changes affecting documentation and commentary										
										
    tz-link.htm says why governments should give plenty of notice for										
    time zone or DST changes, and refers to Matt Johnson's blog post.										
										
    tz-link.htm mentions Tzdata for Elixir.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)

    Asia/Magadan switches from +10 to +11 on 2016-04-24 at 02:00.										
    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev and Matt Johnson.)										
										
    New zone Asia/Tomsk, split off from Asia/Novosibirsk.  It covers										
    Tomsk Oblast, Russia, which switches from +06 to +07 on 2016-05-29										
    at 02:00.  (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)										
										
  Changes affecting past time stamps										
										
    New zone Europe/Kirov, split off from Europe/Volgograd.  It covers										
    Kirov Oblast, Russia, which switched from +04/+05 to +03/+04 on										
    1989-03-26 at 02:00, roughly a year after Europe/Volgograd made										
    the same change.  (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)										
										
    Russia and nearby locations had daylight-saving transitions on										
    1992-03-29 at 02:00 and 1992-09-27 at 03:00, instead of on										
    1992-03-28 at 23:00 and 1992-09-26 at 23:00.  (Thanks to Stepan										
    Golosunov.)										
										
    Many corrections to historical time in Kazakhstan from 1991										
    through 2005.  (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)  Replace Kazakhstan's										
    invented time zone abbreviations with numeric abbreviations.										
										
  Changes to commentary										
										
    Mention Internet RFCs 7808 (TZDIST) and 7809 (CalDAV time zone references).

    Azerbaijan no longer observes DST.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
    Chile reverts from permanent to seasonal DST.  (Thanks to Juan										
    Correa for the heads-up, and to Tim Parenti for corrections.)										
    Guess that future transitions are August's and May's second										
    Saturdays at 24:00 mainland time.  Also, call the period from										
    2014-09-07 through 2016-05-14 daylight saving time instead of										
    standard time, as that seems more appropriate now.										
										
  Changes affecting past time stamps										
										
    Europe/Kaliningrad and Europe/Vilnius changed from +03/+04 to										
    +02/+03 on 1989-03-26, not 1991-03-31.  Europe/Volgograd changed										
    from +04/+05 to +03/+04 on 1988-03-27, not 1989-03-26.										
    (Thanks to Stepan Golosunov.)										
										
  Changes to commentary										
										
    Several updates and URLs for historical and proposed Russian changes.

Release 2016b - 2016-03-12 17:30:14 -0800										
										
  Compatibility note										
										
    Starting with release 2016b, some data entries cause zic implementations										
    derived from tz releases 2005j through 2015e to issue warnings like										
"    ""time zone abbreviation differs from POSIX standard (+03)""."										
    These warnings should not otherwise affect zic's output and can safely be										
    ignored on today's platforms, as the warnings refer to a restriction in										
    POSIX.1-1988 that was removed in POSIX.1-2001.  One way to suppress the										
    warnings is to upgrade to zic derived from tz releases 2015f and later.										
										
  Changes affecting future time stamps										
										
    New zones Europe/Astrakhan and Europe/Ulyanovsk for Astrakhan and										
    Ulyanovsk Oblasts, Russia, both of which will switch from +03 to +04 on										
    2016-03-27 at 02:00 local time.  They need distinct zones since their										
    post-1970 histories disagree.  New zone Asia/Barnaul for Altai Krai and										
    Altai Republic, Russia, which will switch from +06 to +07 on the same date										
"    and local time.  The Astrakhan change is already official; the others have"										
    passed the first reading in the State Duma and are extremely likely.										
    Also, Asia/Sakhalin moves from +10 to +11 on 2016-03-27 at 02:00.										
    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev for the heads-up, and to Matt Johnson										
    and Stepan Golosunov for followup.)										
										
    As a trial of a new system that needs less information to be made up,										
"    the new zones use numeric time zone abbreviations like ""+04"""										
"    instead of invented abbreviations like ""ASTT""."										
										
    Haiti will not observe DST in 2016.  (Thanks to Jean Antoine via										
    Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
    Palestine's spring-forward transition on 2016-03-26 is at 01:00, not 00:00.										
    (Thanks to Hannah Kreitem.) Guess future transitions will be March's last										
    Saturday at 01:00, not March's last Friday at 24:00.										
										
  Changes affecting past time stamps										
										
    Europe/Chisinau observed DST during 1990, and switched from +04 to

    A new web page tz-how-to.html.  (Thanks to Bill Seymour.)										
										
    In the Theory file, the description of possible time zone abbreviations in

    Asia/Tehran now has DST predictions for the year 2038 and later,										
    to be March 21 00:00 to September 21 00:00.  This is likely better										
    than predicting no DST, albeit off by a day every now and then.										
										
  Changes affecting past and future time stamps

    An installer can now combine leap seconds with use of the backzone file,										
    e.g., with 'make PACKRATDATA=backzone REDO=posix_right zones'.										
    The old 'make posix_packrat' rule is now marked as obsolescent.										
    (Thanks to Ian Abbott for an initial implementation.)										
										
  Changes affecting documentation and commentary										
										
    A new file LICENSE makes it easier to see that the code and data										
    are mostly public-domain.  (Thanks to James Knight.)  The three										
    non-public-domain files now use the current (3-clause) BSD license										
    instead of older versions of that license.										
										
    tz-link.htm mentions the BDE library (thanks to Andrew Paprocki),

    Norfolk observed DST from 1974-10-27 02:00 to 1975-03-02 02:00.										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    localtime no longer mishandles America/Anchorage after 2037.										
    (Thanks to Bradley White for reporting the bug.)										
										
    On hosts with signed 32-bit time_t, localtime no longer mishandles										
    Pacific/Fiji after 2038-01-16 14:00 UTC.										
										
    The localtime module allows the variables 'timezone', 'daylight',										
    and 'altzone' to be in common storage shared with other modules,										
    and declares them in case the system <time.h> does not.										
    (Problems reported by Kees Dekker.)										
										
    On platforms with tm_zone, strftime.c now assumes it is not NULL.										
    This simplifies the code and is consistent with zdump.c.										
    (Problem reported by Christos Zoulas.)										
										
  Changes affecting documentation										
										
   The tzfile man page now documents that transition times denote the										
   starts (not the ends) of the corresponding time periods.										
   (Ambiguity reported by Bill Seymour.)

    Moldova starts and ends DST at 00:00 UTC, not at 01:00 UTC.										
    (Thanks to Roman Tudos.)										
										
  Changes affecting data format and code										
										
    zic's '-y YEARISTYPE' option is no longer documented.  The TYPE										
"    field of a Rule line should now be '-'; the old values 'even',"										
    'odd', 'uspres', 'nonpres', 'nonuspres' were already undocumented.										
    Although the implementation has not changed, these features do not										
    work in the default installation, they are not used in the data,										
    and they are now considered obsolescent.										
										
    zic now checks that two rules don't take effect at the same time.										
    (Thanks to Jon Skeet and Arthur David Olson.)  Constraints on										
    simultaneity are now documented.										
										
    The two characters '%z' in a zone format now stand for the UTC										
    offset, e.g., '-07' for seven hours behind UTC and '+0530' for										
    five hours and thirty minutes ahead.  This better supports time										
    zone abbreviations conforming to POSIX.1-2001 and later.										
										
  Changes affecting installed data files										
										
    Comments for America/Halifax and America/Glace_Bay have been improved.										
    (Thanks to Brian Inglis.)										
										
    Data entries have been simplified for Atlantic/Canary, Europe/Simferopol,										
    Europe/Sofia, and Europe/Tallinn.  This yields slightly smaller										
    installed data files for Europe/Simferopol and Europe/Tallinn.										
    It does not affect timestamps.  (Thanks to Howard Hinnant.)										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    zdump and zic no longer warn about valid time zone abbreviations										
    like '-05'.										
										
    Some Visual Studio 2013 warnings have been suppressed.										
    (Thanks to Kees Dekker.)										
										
    'date' no longer sets the time of day and its -a, -d, -n and -t										
    options have been removed.  Long obsolescent, the implementation										
    of these features had porting problems.  Builders no longer need										
    to configure HAVE_ADJTIME, HAVE_SETTIMEOFDAY, or HAVE_UTMPX_H.										
    (Thanks to Kees Dekker for pointing out the problem.)										
										
  Changes affecting documentation										
										
    The Theory file mentions naming issues earlier, as these seem to be										
    poorly publicized (thanks to Gilmore Davidson for reporting the problem).

    Morocco will suspend DST from 2015-06-14 03:00 through 2015-07-19 02:00,										
    not 06-13 and 07-18 as we had guessed.  (Thanks to Milamber.)										
										
    Assume Cayman Islands will observe DST starting next year, using US rules.										
    Although it isn't guaranteed, it is the most likely.										
										
  Changes affecting data format										
										
    The file 'iso3166.tab' now uses UTF-8, so that its entries can better										
    spell the names of Åland Islands, Côte d'Ivoire, and Réunion.										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    When displaying data, tzselect converts it to the current locale's										
    encoding if the iconv command works.  (Problem reported by random832.)										
										
    tzselect no longer mishandles Dominica, fixing a bug introduced										
    in Release 2014f.  (Problem reported by Owen Leibman.)										
										
"    zic -l no longer fails when compiled with -DTZDEFAULT=\""/etc/localtime\""."

  Changes affecting past time stamps										
										
    America/Whitehorse switched from UT -09 to -08 on 1967-05-28, not										
    1966-07-01.  Also, Yukon's time zone history is documented better.										
    (Thanks to Brian Inglis and Dennis Ferguson.)										
										
  Change affecting past and future time zone abbreviations										
										
    The abbreviations for Hawaii-Aleutian standard and daylight times										
    have been changed from HAST/HADT to HST/HDT, as per US Government										
    Printing Office style.  This affects only America/Adak since 1983,										
    as America/Honolulu was already using the new style.

  Changes affecting future time stamps										
										
    Egypt's spring-forward transition is at 24:00 on April's last Thursday,										
    not 00:00 on April's last Friday.  2015's transition will therefore be on										
    Thursday, April 30 at 24:00, not Friday, April 24 at 00:00.  Similar fixes										
    apply to 2026, 2037, 2043, etc.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
  Changes affecting past time stamps										
										
    The following changes affect some pre-1991 Chile-related time stamps										
    in America/Santiago, Antarctica/Palmer, and Pacific/Easter.										
										
      The 1910 transition was January 10, not January 1.										
										
      The 1918 transition was September 10, not September 1.										
										
      The UT -04 time observed from 1932 to 1942 is now considered to										
      be standard time, not year-round DST.										
										
      Santiago observed DST (UT -03) from 1946-07-15 through										
      1946-08-31, then reverted to standard time, then switched to -05										
      on 1947-04-01.										
										
      Assume transitions before 1968 were at 00:00, since we have no data										
      saying otherwise.										
										
      The spring 1988 transition was 1988-10-09, not 1988-10-02.										
      The fall 1990 transition was 1990-03-11, not 1990-03-18.										
										
      Assume no UTC offset change for Pacific/Easter on 1890-01-01,										
      and omit all transitions on Pacific/Easter from 1942 through 1946										
      since we have no data suggesting that they existed.										
										
    One more zone has been turned into a link, as it differed										
    from an existing zone only for older time stamps.  As usual,										
    this change affects UTC offsets in pre-1970 time stamps only.										
    The zone's old contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.										
    The affected zone is America/Montreal.

    The affected zones are: Asia/Aden, Asia/Bahrain, Asia/Kuwait,										
    and Asia/Muscat.

    tzalloc now scrubs time zone abbreviations compatibly with the way										
    that tzset always has, by replacing invalid bytes with '_' and by										
    shortening too-long abbreviations.										
										
    tzselect ports to POSIX awk implementations, no longer mishandles										
    POSIX TZ settings when GNU awk is used, and reports POSIX TZ										
    settings to the user.  (Thanks to Stefan Kuhn.)										
										
  Changes affecting build procedure										
										
    'make check' now checks for links to links in the data.										
    One such link (for Africa/Asmera) has been fixed.

  Changes affecting past time stamps										
										
    Many pre-1989 time stamps have been corrected for Asia/Seoul and										
    Asia/Pyongyang, based on sources for the Korean-language Wikipedia										
    entry for time in Korea.  (Thanks to Sanghyuk Jung.)  Also, no										
    longer guess that Pyongyang mimicked Seoul time after World War II,										
    as this is politically implausible.										
										
    Some more zones have been turned into links, when they differed										
    from existing zones only for older time stamps.  As usual,										
    these changes affect UTC offsets in pre-1970 time stamps only.

    A new Zone Pacific/Bougainville, for the part of Papua New Guinea										
    that plans to switch from UT +10 to +11 on 2014-12-28 at 02:00.										
    (Thanks to Kiley Walbom for the heads-up.)										
										
  Changes affecting time zone abbreviations										
										
    Since Belarus is not changing its clocks even though Moscow is,										
    the time zone abbreviation in Europe/Minsk is changing from FET										
    to its more-traditional value MSK on 2014-10-26 at 01:00.										
    (Thanks to Alexander Bokovoy for the heads-up about Belarus.)										
										
    The new abbreviation IDT stands for the pre-1976 use of UT +08 in										
    Indochina, to distinguish it better from ICT (+07).										
										
  Changes affecting past time stamps										
										
    Many time stamps have been corrected for Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh before 1976										
    (thanks to Trần Ngọc Quân for an indirect pointer to Trần Tiến Bình's										
    authoritative book).  Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh has been added to										
    zone1970.tab, to give tzselect users in Vietnam two choices,										
    since north and south Vietnam disagreed after our 1970 cutoff.										
										
    Asia/Phnom_Penh and Asia/Vientiane have been turned into links, as										
    they differed from existing zones only for older time stamps.  As										
    usual, these changes affect pre-1970 time stamps only.  Their old										
    contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    The time-related library functions now set errno on failure, and										
    some crashes in the new tzalloc-related library functions have										
    been fixed.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas for reporting most of										
    these problems and for suggesting fixes.)										
										
    If USG_COMPAT is defined and the requested timestamp is standard time,										
    the tz library's localtime and mktime functions now set the extern										
"    variable timezone to a value appropriate for that timestamp; and"										
    similarly for ALTZONE, daylight saving time, and the altzone variable.										
    This change is a companion to the tzname change in 2014h, and is										
    designed to make timezone and altzone more compatible with tzname.										
										
    The tz library's functions now set errno to EOVERFLOW if they fail										
    because the result cannot be represented.  ctime and ctime_r now										
    return NULL and set errno when a timestamp is out of range, rather										
    than having undefined behavior.										
										
    Some bugs associated with the new 2014g functions have been fixed.										
    This includes a bug that largely incapacitated the new functions										
    time2posix_z and posix2time_z.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas.)										
    It also includes some uses of uninitialized variables after tzalloc.										
    The new code uses the standard type 'ssize_t', which the Makefile										
    now gives porting advice about.										
										
  Changes affecting commentary										
										
    Updated URLs for NRC Canada (thanks to Matt Johnson and Brian Inglis).

  Changes affecting past timestamps										
										
    America/Jamaica's 1974 spring-forward transition was Jan. 6, not Apr. 28.										
										
"    Shanks says Asia/Novokuznetsk switched from LMT (not ""NMT"") on 1924-05-01,"										
    not 1920-01-06.  The old entry was based on a misinterpretation of Shanks.										
										
    Some more zones have been turned into links, when they differed										
    from existing zones only for older timestamps.  As usual,										
    these changes affect UTC offsets in pre-1970 timestamps only.										
    Their old contents have been moved to the 'backzone' file.										
    The affected zones are: Africa/Blantyre, Africa/Bujumbura,										
    Africa/Gaborone, Africa/Harare, Africa/Kigali, Africa/Lubumbashi,										
    Africa/Lusaka, Africa/Maseru, and Africa/Mbabane.										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    zdump -V and -v now output gmtoff= values on all platforms,										
    not merely on platforms defining TM_GMTOFF.										
										
    The tz library's localtime and mktime functions now set tzname to a value										
    appropriate for the requested timestamp, and zdump now uses this										
    on platforms not defining TM_ZONE, fixing a 2014g regression.										
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti for reporting the problem.)										
										
    The tz library no longer sets tzname if localtime or mktime fails.										
										
    zdump -c no longer mishandles transitions near year boundaries.										
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti for reporting the problem.)										
										
    An access to uninitialized data has been fixed.										
    (Thanks to Jörg Richter for reporting the problem.)										
										
    When THREAD_SAFE is defined, the code ports to the C11 memory model.										
    A memory leak has been fixed if ALL_STATE and THREAD_SAFE are defined										
    and two threads race to initialize data used by gmtime-like functions.										
    (Thanks to Andy Heninger for reporting the problems.)										
										
  Changes affecting build procedure										
										
    'make check' now checks better for properly-sorted data.										
										
  Changes affecting documentation and commentary										
										
    zdump's gmtoff=N output is now documented, and its isdst=D output										
    is now documented to possibly output D values other than 0 or 1.										
										
    zdump -c's treatment of years is now documented to use the										
    Gregorian calendar and Universal Time without leap seconds,										
    and its behavior at cutoff boundaries is now documented better.										
    (Thanks to Arthur David Olson and Tim Parenti for reporting the problems.)										
										
    Programs are now documented to use the proleptic Gregorian calendar.										
    (Thanks to Alan Barrett for the suggestion.)										
										
    Fractional-second GMT offsets have been documented for civil time										
    in 19th-century Chennai, Jakarta, and New York.

    Asia/Krasnoyarsk, Asia/Omsk, Asia/Samarkand, Asia/Tbilisi,										
    Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Yakutsk, Europe/Riga, Europe/Samara.  For										
    Asia/Yekaterinburg the correction is a few minutes.  (Thanks to										
    Vladimir Karpinsky.)										
										
    The Portuguese decree of 1911-05-26 took effect on 1912-01-01.										
    This affects 1911 timestamps in Africa/Bissau, Africa/Luanda,										
    Atlantic/Azores, and Atlantic/Madeira.  Also, Lisbon's pre-1912										
    GMT offset was -0:36:45 (rounded from -0:36:44.68), not -0:36:32.										
    (Thanks to Stephen Colebourne for pointing to the decree.)										
										
    Asia/Dhaka ended DST on 2009-12-31 at 24:00, not 23:59.										
										
    A new file 'backzone' contains data which may appeal to										
    connoisseurs of old timestamps, although it is out of scope for										
    the tz database, is often poorly sourced, and contains some data										
    that is known to be incorrect.  The new file is not recommended										
    for ordinary use and its entries are not installed by default.										
    (Thanks to Lester Caine for the high-quality Jersey, Guernsey, and										
    Isle of Man entries.)

  Changes affecting code										
										
    Unless NETBSD_INSPIRED is defined to 0, the tz library now										
    supplies functions for creating and using objects that represent										
    time zones. The new functions are tzalloc, tzfree, localtime_rz,										
    mktime_z, and (if STD_INSPIRED is also defined) posix2time_z and										
    time2posix_z.  They are intended for performance: for example,										
    localtime_rz (unlike localtime_r) is trivially thread-safe without										
    locking.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas for proposing NetBSD-inspired										
    functions, and to Alan Barrett and Jonathan Lennox for helping to										
    debug the change.)										
										
    zdump now builds with the tz library unless USE_LTZ is defined to 0,										
    This lets zdump use tz features even if the system library lacks them.										
    To build zdump with the system library, use 'make CFLAGS=-DUSE_LTZ=0										
    TZDOBJS=zdump.o CHECK_TIME_T_ALTERNATIVES='.										
										
    zdump now uses localtime_rz if available, as it's significantly faster,										
    and it can help zdump better diagnose invalid time zone names.										
    Define HAVE_LOCALTIME_RZ to 0 to suppress this.  HAVE_LOCALTIME_RZ										
    defaults to 1 if NETBSD_INSPIRED && USE_LTZ.  When localtime_rz is										
    not available, zdump now uses localtime_r and tzset if available,										
    as this is a bit cleaner and faster than plain localtime.  Compile										
    with -DHAVE_LOCALTIME_R=0 and/or -DHAVE_TZSET=0 if your system										
    lacks these two functions.										
										
    If THREAD_SAFE is defined to 1, the tz library is now thread-safe.										
    Although not needed for tz's own applications, which are single-threaded,										
    this supports POSIX better if the tz library is used in multithreaded apps.										
										
    Some crashes have been fixed when zdump or the tz library is given										
    invalid or outlandish input.										
										
    The tz library no longer mishandles leap seconds on platforms with										
    unsigned time_t in time zones that lack ordinary transitions after 1970.										
										
    The tz code now attempts to infer TM_GMTOFF and TM_ZONE if not										
    already defined, to make it easier to configure on common platforms.										
    Define NO_TM_GMTOFF and NO_TM_ZONE to suppress this.										
										
    Unless the new macro UNINIT_TRAP is defined to 1, the tz code now										
    assumes that reading uninitialized memory yields garbage values										
    but does not cause other problems such as traps.										
										
    If TM_GMTOFF is defined and UNINIT_TRAP is 0, mktime is now										
    more likely to guess right for ambiguous timestamps near										
    transitions where tm_isdst does not change.										
										
    If HAVE_STRFTIME_L is defined to 1, the tz library now defines										
    strftime_l for compatibility with recent versions of POSIX.										
    Only the C locale is supported, though.  HAVE_STRFTIME_L defaults										
    to 1 on recent POSIX versions, and to 0 otherwise.										
										
    tzselect -c now uses a hybrid distance measure that works better										
    in Africa.  (Thanks to Alan Barrett for noting the problem.)										
										
    The C source code now ports to NetBSD when GCC_DEBUG_FLAGS is used,										
    or when time_tz is defined.										
										
    When HAVE_UTMPX_H is set the 'date' command now builds on systems										
    whose <utmpx.h> file does not define WTMPX_FILE, and when setting										
    the date it updates the wtmpx file if _PATH_WTMPX is defined.										
    This affects GNU/Linux and similar systems.										
										
    For easier maintenance later, some C code has been simplified,										
    some lint has been removed, and the code has been tweaked so that										
    plain 'make' is more likely to work.										
										
    The C type 'bool' is now used for boolean values, instead of 'int'.										
										
    The long-obsolete LOCALE_HOME code has been removed.										
										
    The long-obsolete 'gtime' function has been removed.										
										
  Changes affecting build procedure										
										
    'zdump' no longer links in ialloc.o, as it's not needed.										
										
    'make check_time_t_alternatives' no longer assumes GNU diff.										
										
  Changes affecting distribution tarballs										
										
    The files checktab.awk and zoneinfo2tdf.pl are now distributed in										
    the tzdata tarball instead of the tzcode tarball, since they help										
    maintain the data.  The NEWS and Theory files are now also										
    distributed in the tzdata tarball, as they're relevant for data.										
    (Thanks to Alan Barrett for pointing this out.)  Also, the										
    leapseconds.awk file is no longer distributed in the tzcode										
    tarball, since it belongs in the tzdata tarball (where 2014f										
    inadvertently also distributed it).										
										
  Changes affecting documentation and commentary										
										
    A new file CONTRIBUTING is distributed.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for										
    suggesting a CONTRIBUTING file, and to Tony Finch and Walter Harms										
    for debugging it.)										
										
    The man pages have been updated to use function prototypes,										
    to document thread-safe variants like localtime_r, and to document										
    the NetBSD-inspired functions tzalloc, tzfree, localtime_rz, and										
    mktime_z.										
										
    The fields in Link lines have been renamed to be more descriptive										
    and more like the parameters of 'ln'.  LINK-FROM has become TARGET,										
    and LINK-TO has become LINK-NAME.										
										
"    tz-link.htm mentions the IETF's tzdist working group; Windows"										
"    Runtime etc. (thanks to Matt Johnson); and HP-UX's tztab."										
										
    Some broken URLs have been fixed in the commentary.  (Thanks to										
    Lester Caine.)										
										
    Commentary about Philippines DST has been updated, and commentary										
    on pre-1970 time in India has been added.										
										
										
Release 2014f - 2014-08-05 17:42:36 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting future timestamps										
										
    Russia will subtract an hour from most of its time zones on 2014-10-26										
    at 02:00 local time.  (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev.)										
    There are a few exceptions: Magadan Oblast (Asia/Magadan) and Zabaykalsky										
"    Krai are subtracting two hours; conversely, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug"										
    (Asia/Anadyr), Kamchatka Krai (Asia/Kamchatka), Kemerovo Oblast										
    (Asia/Novokuznetsk), and the Samara Oblast and the Udmurt Republic										
    (Europe/Samara) are not changing their clocks.  The changed zones are										
    Europe/Kaliningrad, Europe/Moscow, Europe/Simferopol, Europe/Volgograd,										
    Asia/Yekaterinburg, Asia/Omsk, Asia/Novosibirsk, Asia/Krasnoyarsk,										
    Asia/Irkutsk, Asia/Yakutsk, Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Khandyga,										
"    Asia/Sakhalin, and Asia/Ust-Nera; Asia/Magadan will have two hours"										
"    subtracted; and Asia/Novokuznetsk's time zone abbreviation is affected,"										
    but not its UTC offset.  Two zones are added: Asia/Chita (split										
    from Asia/Yakutsk, and also with two hours subtracted) and										
    Asia/Srednekolymsk (split from Asia/Magadan, but with only one hour										
    subtracted).  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for much of the above.)										
										
  Changes affecting time zone abbreviations										
										
    Australian eastern time zone abbreviations are now AEST/AEDT not EST,										
    and similarly for the other Australian zones.  That is, for eastern										
    standard and daylight saving time the abbreviations are AEST and AEDT										
"    instead of the former EST for both; similarly, ACST/ACDT, ACWST/ACWDT,"										
    and AWST/AWDT are now used instead of the former CST, CWST, and WST.										
    This change does not affect UTC offsets, only time zone abbreviations.										
    (Thanks to Rich Tibbett and many others.)										
										
    Asia/Novokuznetsk shifts from NOVT to KRAT (remaining on UT +07)										
    effective 2014-10-26 at 02:00 local time.										
										
    The time zone abbreviation for Xinjiang Time (observed in Ürümqi)										
    has been changed from URUT to XJT.  (Thanks to Luther Ma.)										
										
    Prefer MSK/MSD for Moscow time in Russia, even in other cities.										
    Similarly, prefer EET/EEST for eastern European time in Russia.										
										
"    Change time zone abbreviations in (western) Samoa to use ""ST"" and"										
"    ""DT"" suffixes, as this is more likely to match common practice."										
"    Prefix ""W"" to (western) Samoa time when its standard-time offset"										
    disagrees with that of American Samoa.										
										
    America/Metlakatla now uses PST, not MeST, to abbreviate its time zone.										
										
    Time zone abbreviations have been updated for Japan's two time										
    zones used 1896-1937.  JWST now stands for Western Standard										
    Time, and JCST for Central Standard Time (formerly this was CJT).										
    These abbreviations are now used for time in Korea, Taiwan,										
    and Sakhalin while controlled by Japan.										
										
  Changes affecting past timestamps										
										
    China's five zones have been simplified to two, since the post-1970										
    differences in the other three seem to have been imaginary.  The										
    zones Asia/Harbin, Asia/Chongqing, and Asia/Kashgar have been										
"    removed; backwards-compatibility links still work, albeit with"										
    different behaviors for timestamps before May 1980.  Asia/Urumqi's										
    1980 transition to UT +08 has been removed, so that it is now at										
"    +06 and not +08.  (Thanks to Luther Ma and to Alois Treindl;"										
    Treindl sent helpful translations of two papers by Guo Qingsheng.)										
										
    Some zones have been turned into links, when they differed from existing										
    zones only for older UTC offsets where data entries were likely invented.										
    These changes affect UTC offsets in pre-1970 timestamps only.  This is										
    similar to the change in release 2013e, except this time for western										
    Africa.  The affected zones are: Africa/Bamako, Africa/Banjul,										
    Africa/Conakry, Africa/Dakar, Africa/Freetown, Africa/Lome,										
    Africa/Nouakchott, Africa/Ouagadougou, Africa/Sao_Tome, and										
    Atlantic/St_Helena.  This also affects the backwards-compatibility										
    link Africa/Timbuktu.  (Thanks to Alan Barrett, Stephen Colebourne,										
    Tim Parenti, and David Patte for reporting problems in earlier										
    versions of this change.)										
										
    Asia/Shanghai's pre-standard-time UT offset has been changed from										
    8:05:57 to 8:05:43, the location of Xujiahui Observatory.  Its										
    transition to standard time has been changed from 1928 to 1901.										
										
    Asia/Taipei switched to JWST on 1896-01-01, then to JST on 1937-10-01,										
    then to CST on 1945-09-21 at 01:00, and did not observe DST in 1945.										
"    In 1946 it observed DST from 05-15 through 09-30; in 1947"										
"    from 04-15 through 10-31; and in 1979 from 07-01 through 09-30."										
    (Thanks to Yu-Cheng Chuang.)										
										
    Asia/Riyadh's transition to standard time is now 1947-03-14, not 1950.										
										
    Europe/Helsinki's 1942 fall-back transition was 10-04 at 01:00, not										
    10-03 at 00:00.  (Thanks to Konstantin Hyppönen.)										
										
    Pacific/Pago_Pago has been changed from UT -11:30 to -11 for the										
    period from 1911 to 1950.										
										
    Pacific/Chatham has been changed to New Zealand standard time plus										
    45 minutes for the period before 1957, reflecting a 1956 remark in										
    the New Zealand parliament.										
										
    Europe/Budapest has several pre-1946 corrections: in 1918 the transition										
"    out of DST was on 09-16, not 09-29; in 1919 it was on 11-24, not 09-15; in"										
"    1945 it was on 11-01, not 11-03; in 1941 the transition to DST was 04-08"										
"    not 04-06 at 02:00; and there was no DST in 1920."										
										
    Africa/Accra is now assumed to have observed DST from 1920 through 1935.										
										
    Time in Russia before 1927 or so has been corrected by a few seconds in										
    the following zones: Europe/Moscow, Asia/Irkutsk, Asia/Tbilisi,										
    Asia/Tashkent, Asia/Vladivostok, Asia/Yekaterinburg, Europe/Helsinki, and										
    Europe/Riga.  Also, Moscow's location has been changed to its Kilometer 0										
    point.  (Thanks to Vladimir Karpinsky for the Moscow changes.)										
										
  Changes affecting data format										
										
    A new file 'zone1970.tab' supersedes 'zone.tab' in the installed data.										
    The new file's extended format allows multiple country codes per zone.										
"    The older file is still installed but is deprecated; its format is"										
    not changing and it will still be distributed for a while, but new										
    applications should use the new file.										
										
    The new file format simplifies maintenance of obscure locations.										
    To test this, it adds coverage for the Crozet Islands and the										
    Scattered Islands.  (Thanks to Tobias Conradi and Antoine Leca.)										
										
    The file 'iso3166.tab' is planned to switch from ASCII to UTF-8.										
    It is still ASCII now, but commentary about the switch has been added.										
    The new file 'zone1970.tab' already uses UTF-8.										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    'localtime', 'mktime', etc. now use much less stack space if ALL_STATE										
    is defined.  (Thanks to Elliott Hughes for reporting the problem.)										
										
    'zic' no longer mishandles input when ignoring case in locales that										
    are not compatible with English, e.g., unibyte Turkish locales when										
    compiled with HAVE_GETTEXT.										
										
    Error diagnostics of 'zic' and 'yearistype' have been reworded so that										
    they no longer use ASCII '-' as if it were a dash.										
										
    'zic' now rejects output file names that contain '.' or '..' components.										
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti for reporting the problem.)										
										
    'zic -v' now warns about output file names that do not follow										
    POSIX rules, or that contain a digit or '.'.  (Thanks to Arthur										
    David Olson for starting the ball rolling on this.)										
										
    Some lint has been removed when using GCC_DEBUG_FLAGS with GCC 4.9.0.										
										
  Changes affecting build procedure										
										
    'zic' no longer links in localtime.o and asctime.o, as they're not needed.										
    (Thanks to John Cochran.)										
										
  Changes affecting documentation and commentary										
										
    The 'Theory' file documents legacy names, the longstanding										
    exceptions to the POSIX-inspired file name rules.										
										
    The 'zic' documentation clarifies the role of time types when										
    interpreting dates.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)										
										
    Documentation and commentary now prefer UTF-8 to US-ASCII,										
    allowing the use of proper accents in foreign words and names.										
    Code and data have not changed because of this.  (Thanks to										
    Garrett Wollman, Ian Abbott, and Guy Harris for helping to debug										
    this.)										
										
    Non-HTML documentation and commentary now use plain-text URLs instead of										
    HTML insertions, and are more consistent about bracketing URLs when they										
    are not already surrounded by white space.  (Thanks to suggestions by										
    Steffen Nurpmeso.)										
										
    There is new commentary about Xujiahui Observatory, the five time-zone										
    project in China from 1918 to 1949, timekeeping in Japanese-occupied										
    Shanghai, and Tibet Time in the 1950s.  The sharp-eyed can spot the										
    warlord Jin Shuren in the data.										
										
    Commentary about the coverage of each Russian zone has been standardized.										
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti).										
										
    There is new commentary about contemporary timekeeping in Ethiopia.										
										
    Obsolete comments about a 2007 proposal for DST in Kuwait has been removed.										
										
    There is new commentary about time in Poland in 1919.										
										
    Proper credit has been given to DST inventor George Vernon Hudson.										
										
    Commentary about time in Metlakatla, AK and Resolute, NU has been										
    improved, with a new source for the former.										
										
    In zone.tab, Pacific/Easter no longer mentions Salas y Gómez, as it										
    is uninhabited.										
										
    Commentary about permanent Antarctic bases has been updated.										
										
    Several typos have been corrected.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for										
    contributing some of these fixes.)										
										
    tz-link.htm now mentions the JavaScript libraries Moment Timezone,										
    TimezoneJS.Date, Walltime-js, and Timezone.  (Thanks to a heads-up										
    from Matt Johnson.)  Also, it mentions the Go 'latlong' package.										
    (Thanks to a heads-up from Dirkjan Ochtman.)										
										
    The files usno1988, usno1989, usno1989a, usno1995, usno1997, and usno1998										
    have been removed.  These obsolescent US Naval Observatory entries were no										
    longer helpful for maintenance.  (Thanks to Tim Parenti for the suggestion.)										
										
										
Release 2014e - 2014-06-12 21:53:52 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting near-future timestamps										
										
    Egypt's 2014 Ramadan-based transitions are June 26 and July 31 at 24:00.										
    (Thanks to Imed Chihi.)  Guess that from 2015 on Egypt will temporarily										
    switch to standard time at 24:00 the last Thursday before Ramadan, and										
    back to DST at 00:00 the first Friday after Ramadan.										
										
    Similarly, Morocco's are June 28 at 03:00 and August 2 at 02:00.  (Thanks										
    to Milamber Space Network.)  Guess that from 2015 on Morocco will										
    temporarily switch to standard time at 03:00 the last Saturday before										
    Ramadan, and back to DST at 02:00 the first Saturday after Ramadan.										
										
  Changes affecting past timestamps										
										
"    The abbreviation ""MSM"" (Moscow Midsummer Time) is now used instead of"										
"    ""MSD"" for Moscow's double daylight time in summer 1921.  Also, a typo"										
"    ""VLASST"" has been repaired to be ""VLAST"" for Vladivostok summer time"										
    in 1991.  (Thanks to Hank W. for reporting the problems.)										
										
  Changes affecting commentary										
										
    tz-link.htm now cites RFC 7265 for jCal, mentions PTP and the										
    draft CalDAV extension, updates URLs for TSP, TZInfo, IATA, and										
    removes stale pointers to World Time Explorer and WORLDTIME.										
										
										
Release 2014d - 2014-05-27 21:34:40 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    zic no longer generates files containing timestamps before the Big Bang.										
    This works around GNOME bug 730332										
    <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=730332>.										
    (Thanks to Leonardo Chiquitto for reporting the bug, and to										
    Arthur David Olson and James Cloos for suggesting improvements to the fix.)										
										
  Changes affecting documentation										
										
    tz-link.htm now mentions GNOME.										
										
										
Release 2014c - 2014-05-13 07:44:13 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting near-future timestamps										
										
    Egypt observes DST starting 2014-05-15 at 24:00.										
    (Thanks to Ahmad El-Dardiry and Gunther Vermier.)										
    Details have not been announced, except that DST will not be observed										
    during Ramadan.  Guess that DST will stop during the same Ramadan dates as										
    Morocco, and that Egypt's future spring and fall transitions will be the										
    same as 2010 when it last observed DST, namely April's last Friday at										
    00:00 to September's last Thursday at 23:00 standard time.  Also, guess										
    that Ramadan transitions will be at 00:00 standard time.										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    zic now generates transitions for minimum time values, eliminating guesswork										
    when handling low-valued timestamps.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)										
										
    Port to Cygwin sans glibc.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)										
										
  Changes affecting commentary and documentation										
										
    Remove now-confusing comment about Jordan.  (Thanks to Oleksii Nochovnyi.)										
										
										
Release 2014b - 2014-03-24 21:28:50 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting near-future timestamps										
										
    Crimea switches to Moscow time on 2014-03-30 at 02:00 local time.										
    (Thanks to Alexander Krivenyshev.)  Move its zone.tab entry from UA to RU.										
										
    New entry for Troll station, Antarctica.  (Thanks to Paul-Inge Flakstad and										
"    Bengt-Inge Larsson.)  This is currently an approximation; a better version"										
    will require the zic and localtime fixes mentioned below, and the plan is										
    to wait for a while until at least the zic fixes propagate.										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    'zic' and 'localtime' no longer reject locations needing four transitions										
    per year for the foreseeable future.  (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram).)										
    Also, 'zic' avoids some unlikely failures due to integer overflow.										
										
  Changes affecting build procedure										
										
    'make check' now detects Rule lines defined but never used.										
    The NZAQ rules, an instance of this problem, have been removed.										
										
  Changes affecting commentary and documentation										
										
    Fix Tuesday/Thursday typo in description of time in Israel.										
    (Thanks to Bert Katz via Pavel Kharitonov and Mike Frysinger.)										
										
    Microsoft Windows 8.1 doesn't support tz database names.  (Thanks										
    to Donald MacQueen.)  Instead, the Microsoft Windows Store app										
    library supports them.										
										
    Add comments about Johnston Island time in the 1960s.										
    (Thanks to Lyle McElhaney.)										
										
    Morocco's 2014 DST start will be as predicted.										
    (Thanks to Sebastien Willemijns.)										
										
										
Release 2014a - 2014-03-07 23:30:29 -0800										
										
  Changes affecting near-future timestamps										
										
    Turkey begins DST on 2014-03-31, not 03-30.  (Thanks to Faruk Pasin for										
    the heads-up, and to Tim Parenti for simplifying the update.)										
										
  Changes affecting past timestamps										
										
    Fiji ended DST on 2014-01-19 at 02:00, not the previously-scheduled 03:00.										
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
    Ukraine switched from Moscow to Eastern European time on 1990-07-01										
    (not 1992-01-01), and observed DST during the entire next winter.										
    (Thanks to Vladimir in Moscow via Alois Treindl.)										
										
    In 1988 Israel observed DST from 04-10 to 09-04, not 04-09 to 09-03.										
    (Thanks to Avigdor Finkelstein.)										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    A uninitialized-storage bug in 'localtime' has been fixed.										
    (Thanks to Logan Chien.)										
										
  Changes affecting the build procedure										
										
    The settings for 'make check_web' now default to Ubuntu 13.10.										
										
  Changes affecting commentary and documentation										
										
    The boundary of the US Pacific time zone is given more accurately.										
    (Thanks to Alan Mintz.)										
										
    Chile's 2014 DST will be as predicted.  (Thanks to José Miguel Garrido.)										
										
    Paraguay's 2014 DST will be as predicted.  (Thanks to Carlos Raúl Perasso.)										
										
    Better descriptions of countries with same time zone history as										
    Trinidad and Tobago since 1970.  (Thanks to Alan Barrett for suggestion.)										
										
    Several changes affect tz-link.htm, the main web page.										
										
      Mention Time.is (thanks to Even Scharning) and WX-now (thanks to										
      David Braverman).										
										
      Mention xCal (Internet RFC 6321) and jCal.										
										
      Microsoft has some support for tz database names.										
										
      CLDR data formats include both XML and JSON.										
										
      Mention Maggiolo's map of solar vs standard time.										
      (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)										
										
      Mention TZ4Net.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)										
										
      Mention the timezone-olson Haskell package.										
										
      Mention zeitverschiebung.net.  (Thanks to Martin Jäger.)										
										
      Remove moribund links to daylight-savings-time.info and to										
      Simple Timer + Clocks.										
										
      Update two links.  (Thanks to Oscar van Vlijmen.)										
										
      Fix some formatting glitches, e.g., remove random newlines from										
      abbr elements' title attributes.										
										
										
Release 2013i - 2013-12-17 07:25:23 -0800										
										
  Changes affecting near-future timestamps:										
										
    Jordan switches back to standard time at 00:00 on December 20, 2013.										
    The 2006-2011 transition schedule is planned to resume in 2014.										
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
  Changes affecting past timestamps:										
										
    In 2004, Cuba began DST on March 28, not April 4.										
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    The compile-time flag NOSOLAR has been removed, as nowadays the										
    benefit of slightly shrinking runtime table size is outweighed by the										
    cost of disallowing potential future updates that exceed old limits.										
										
  Changes affecting documentation and commentary										
										
    The files solar87, solar88, and solar89 are no longer distributed.										
    They were a negative experiment - that is, a demonstration that										
    tz data can represent solar time only with some difficulty and error.										
    Their presence in the distribution caused confusion, as Riyadh										
    civil time was generally not solar time in those years.										
										
    tz-link.htm now mentions Noda Time.  (Thanks to Matt Johnson.)										
										
										
Release 2013h - 2013-10-25 15:32:32 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting current and future timestamps:										
										
    Libya has switched its UT offset back to +02 without DST, instead										
    of +01 with DST.  (Thanks to Even Scharning.)										
										
    Western Sahara (Africa/El_Aaiun) uses Morocco's DST rules.										
    (Thanks to Gwillim Law.)										
										
  Changes affecting future timestamps:										
										
    Acre and (we guess) western Amazonas will switch from UT -04 to -05										
    on 2013-11-10.  This affects America/Rio_Branco and America/Eirunepe.										
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
    Add entries for DST transitions in Morocco in the year 2038.										
    This avoids some year-2038 glitches introduced in 2013g.										
    (Thanks to Yoshito Umaoka for reporting the problem.)										
										
  Changes affecting API										
										
    The 'tzselect' command no longer requires the 'select' command,										
    and should now work with /bin/sh on more platforms.  It also works										
    around a bug in BusyBox awk before version 1.21.0.  (Thanks to										
    Patrick 'P. J.' McDermott and Alan Barrett.)										
										
  Changes affecting code										
										
    Fix localtime overflow bugs with 32-bit unsigned time_t.										
										
    zdump no longer assumes sscanf returns maximal values on overflow.										
										
  Changes affecting the build procedure										
										
    The builder can specify which programs to use, if any, instead of										
    'ar' and 'ranlib', and libtz.a is now built locally before being										
    installed.  (Thanks to Michael Forney.)										
										
    A dependency typo in the 'zdump' rule has been fixed.										
    (Thanks to Andrew Paprocki.)										
										
    The Makefile has been simplified by assuming that 'mkdir -p' and 'cp -f'										
"    work as specified by POSIX.2-1992 or later; this is portable nowadays."										
										
    'make clean' no longer removes 'leapseconds', since it's										
    host-independent and is part of the distribution.										
										
    The unused makefile macros TZCSRCS, TZDSRCS, DATESRCS have been removed.										
										
  Changes affecting documentation and commentary										
										
    tz-link.htm now mentions TC TIMEZONE's draft time zone service protocol										
    (thanks to Mike Douglass) and TimezoneJS.Date (thanks to Jim Fehrle).										
										
    Update URLs in tz-link page.  Add URLs for Microsoft Windows, since										
    8.1 introduces tz support.  Remove URLs for Tru64 and UnixWare (no										
    longer maintained) and for old advisories.  SOFA now does C.										
										
Release 2013g - 2013-09-30 21:08:26 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting current and near-future timestamps										
										
    Morocco now observes DST from the last Sunday in March to the last										
    Sunday in October, not April to September respectively.  (Thanks										
    to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
  Changes affecting 'zic'										
										
    'zic' now runs on platforms that lack both hard links and symlinks.										
    (Thanks to Theo Veenker for reporting the problem, for MinGW.)										
    Also, fix some bugs on platforms that lack hard links but have symlinks.										
										
    'zic -v' again warns that Asia/Tehran has no POSIX environment variable										
    to predict the far future, fixing a bug introduced in 2013e.										
										
  Changes affecting the build procedure										
										
    The 'leapseconds' file is again put into the tzdata tarball.										
    Also, 'leapseconds.awk', so tzdata is self-contained.  (Thanks to										
    Matt Burgess and Ian Abbott.)  The timestamps of these and other										
    dependent files in tarballs are adjusted more consistently.										
										
  Changes affecting documentation and commentary										
										
    The README file is now part of the data tarball as well as the code.										
    It now states that files are public domain unless otherwise specified.										
    (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram) for asking for clarifications.)										
    Its details about the 1989 release moved to a place of honor near										
    the end of NEWS.										
										
										
Release 2013f - 2013-09-24 23:37:36 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting near-future timestamps										
										
    Tocantins will very likely not observe DST starting this spring.										
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
    Jordan will likely stay at UT +03 indefinitely, and will not fall										
    back this fall.										
										
    Palestine will fall back at 00:00, not 01:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
  Changes affecting API										
										
    The types of the global variables 'timezone' and 'altzone' (if present)										
    have been changed back to 'long'.  This is required for 'timezone'										
    by POSIX, and for 'altzone' by common practice, e.g., Solaris 11.										
    These variables were originally 'long' in the tz code, but were										
"    mistakenly changed to 'time_t' in 1987; nobody reported the"										
    incompatibility until now.  The difference matters on x32, where										
    'long' is 32 bits and 'time_t' is 64.  (Thanks to Elliott Hughes.)										
										
  Changes affecting the build procedure										
										
    Avoid long strings in leapseconds.awk to work around a mawk bug.										
    (Thanks to Cyril Baurand.)										
										
  Changes affecting documentation and commentary										
										
    New file 'NEWS' that contains release notes like this one.										
										
"    Paraguay's law does not specify DST transition time; 00:00 is customary."										
    (Thanks to Waldemar Villamayor-Venialbo.)										
										
    Minor capitalization fixes.										
										
  Changes affecting version-control only										
										
    The experimental GitHub repository now contains annotated and										
    signed tags for recent releases, e.g., '2013e' for Release 2013e.										
"    Releases are tagged starting with 2012e; earlier releases were"										
    done differently, and tags would either not have a simple name or										
    not exactly match what was released.										
										
    'make set-timestamps' is now simpler and a bit more portable.										
										
										
Release 2013e - 2013-09-19 23:50:04 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting near-future timestamps										
										
    This year Fiji will start DST on October 27, not October 20.										
    (Thanks to David Wheeler for the heads-up.)  For now, guess that										
    Fiji will continue to spring forward the Sunday before the fourth										
    Monday in October.										
										
  Changes affecting current and future time zone abbreviations										
										
    Use WIB/WITA/WIT rather than WIT/CIT/EIT for alphabetic Indonesian										
    time zone abbreviations since 1932.  (Thanks to George Ziegler,										
    Priyadi Iman Nurcahyo, Zakaria, Jason Grimes, Martin Pitt, and										
    Benny Lin.)  This affects Asia/Dili, Asia/Jakarta, Asia/Jayapura,										
    Asia/Makassar, and Asia/Pontianak.										
										
    Use ART (UT -03, standard time), rather than WARST (also -03, but										
    daylight saving time) for San Luis, Argentina since 2009.										
										
  Changes affecting Godthåb timestamps after 2037 if version mismatch										
										
    Allow POSIX-like TZ strings where the transition time's hour can										
    range from -167 through 167, instead of the POSIX-required 0										
    through 24.  E.g., TZ='FJT-12FJST,M10.3.1/146,M1.3.4/75' for the										
    new Fiji rules.  This is a more-compact way to represent										
    far-future timestamps for America/Godthab, America/Santiago,										
    Antarctica/Palmer, Asia/Gaza, Asia/Hebron, Asia/Jerusalem,										
    Pacific/Easter, and Pacific/Fiji.  Other zones are unaffected by										
    this change.  (Derived from a suggestion by Arthur David Olson.)										
										
    Allow POSIX-like TZ strings where daylight saving time is in										
    effect all year.  E.g., TZ='WART4WARST,J1/0,J365/25' for Western										
    Argentina Summer Time all year.  This supports a more-compact way										
    to represent the 2013d data for America/Argentina/San_Luis.										
    Because of the change for San Luis noted above this change does not										
    affect the current data.  (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram) for										
    suggestions that improved this change.)										
										
    Where these two TZ changes take effect, there is a minor extension										
    to the tz file format in that it allows new values for the										
    embedded TZ-format string, and the tz file format version number										
    has therefore been increased from 2 to 3 as a precaution.										
    Version-2-based client code should continue to work as before for										
    all timestamps before 2038.  Existing version-2-based client code										
    (tzcode, GNU/Linux, Solaris) has been tested on version-3-format										
    files, and typically works in practice even for timestamps after										
"    2037; the only known exception is America/Godthab."										
										
  Changes affecting timestamps before 1970										
										
    Pacific/Johnston is now a link to Pacific/Honolulu.  This corrects										
    some errors before 1947.										
										
    Some zones have been turned into links, when they differ from existing										
    zones only in older data entries that were likely invented or that										
    differ only in LMT or transitions from LMT.  These changes affect										
    only timestamps before 1943.  The affected zones are:										
    Africa/Juba, America/Anguilla, America/Aruba, America/Dominica,										
    America/Grenada, America/Guadeloupe, America/Marigot,										
    America/Montserrat, America/St_Barthelemy, America/St_Kitts,										
    America/St_Lucia, America/St_Thomas, America/St_Vincent,										
    America/Tortola, and Europe/Vaduz.  (Thanks to Alois Treindl for										
    confirming that the old Europe/Vaduz zone was wrong and the new										
    link is better for WWII-era times.)										
										
    Change Kingston Mean Time from -5:07:12 to -5:07:11.  This affects										
    America/Cayman, America/Jamaica and America/Grand_Turk timestamps										
    from 1890 to 1912.										
										
    Change the UT offset of Bern Mean Time from 0:29:44 to 0:29:46.										
    This affects Europe/Zurich timestamps from 1853 to 1894.  (Thanks										
    to Alois Treindl).										
										
    Change the date of the circa-1850 Zurich transition from 1849-09-12										
    to 1853-07-16, overriding Shanks with data from Messerli about										
    postal and telegraph time in Switzerland.										
										
  Changes affecting time zone abbreviations before 1970										
										
    For Asia/Jakarta, use BMT (not JMT) for mean time from 1923 to 1932,										
    as Jakarta was called Batavia back then.										
										
  Changes affecting API										
										
    The 'zic' command now outputs a dummy transition when far-future										
    data can't be summarized using a TZ string, and uses a 402-year										
    window rather than a 400-year window.  For the current data, this										
    affects only the Asia/Tehran file.  It does not affect any of the										
    timestamps that this file represents, so zdump outputs the same										
    information as before.  (Thanks to Andrew Main (Zefram).)										
										
    The 'date' command has a new '-r' option, which lets you specify										
    the integer time to display, a la FreeBSD.										
										
    The 'tzselect' command has two new options '-c' and '-n', which lets you										
    select a zone based on latitude and longitude.										
										
    The 'zic' command's '-v' option now warns about constructs that										
    require the new version-3 binary file format.  (Thanks to Arthur										
    David Olson for the suggestion.)										
										
    Support for floating-point time_t has been removed.										
    It was always dicey, and POSIX no longer requires it.										
    (Thanks to Eric Blake for suggesting to the POSIX committee to										
    remove it, and thanks to Alan Barrett, Clive D.W. Feather, Andy										
    Heninger, Arthur David Olson, and Alois Treindl, for reporting										
    bugs and elucidating some of the corners of the old floating-point										
    implementation.)										
										
    The signatures of 'offtime', 'timeoff', and 'gtime' have been										
    changed back to the old practice of using 'long' to represent UT										
    offsets.  This had been inadvertently and mistakenly changed to										
    'int_fast32_t'.  (Thanks to Christos Zoulas.)										
										
    The code avoids undefined behavior on integer overflow in some										
    more places, including gmtime, localtime, mktime and zdump.										
										
  Changes affecting the zdump utility										
										
"    zdump now outputs ""UT"" when referring to Universal Time, not ""UTC""."										
"    ""UTC"" does not make sense for timestamps that predate the introduction"										
"    of UTC, whereas ""UT"", a more-generic term, does.  (Thanks to Steve Allen"										
    for clarifying UT vs UTC.)										
										
  Data changes affecting behavior of tzselect and similar programs										
										
"    Country code BQ is now called the more-common name ""Caribbean Netherlands"""										
"    rather than the more-official ""Bonaire, St Eustatius & Saba""."										
										
    Remove from zone.tab the names America/Montreal, America/Shiprock,										
    and Antarctica/South_Pole, as they are equivalent to existing										
    same-country-code zones for post-1970 timestamps.  The data entries for										
    these names are unchanged, so the names continue to work as before.										
										
  Changes affecting code internals										
										
    zic -c now runs way faster on 64-bit hosts when given large numbers.										
										
    zic now uses vfprintf to avoid allocating and freeing some memory.										
										
    tzselect now computes the list of continents from the data,										
    rather than have it hard-coded.										
										
    Minor changes pacify GCC 4.7.3 and GCC 4.8.1.										
										
  Changes affecting the build procedure										
										
    The 'leapseconds' file is now generated automatically from a										
    new file 'leap-seconds.list', which is a copy of										
    <ftp://ftp.nist.gov/pub/time/leap-seconds.list>										
    A new source file 'leapseconds.awk' implements this.										
    The goal is simplification of the future maintenance of 'leapseconds'.										
										
    When building the 'posix' or 'right' subdirectories, if the										
    subdirectory would be a copy of the default subdirectory, it is										
    now made a symbolic link if that is supported.  This saves about										
    2 MB of file system space.										
										
    The links America/Shiprock and Antarctica/South_Pole have been										
    moved to the 'backward' file.  This affects only nondefault builds										
    that omit 'backward'.										
										
  Changes affecting version-control only										
										
    .gitignore now ignores 'date'.										
										
  Changes affecting documentation and commentary										
										
    Changes to the 'tzfile' man page										
										
      It now mentions that the binary file format may be extended in										
      future versions by appending data.										
										
      It now refers to the 'zdump' and 'zic' man pages.										
										
    Changes to the 'zic' man page										
										
      It lists conditions that elicit a warning with '-v'.										
										
      It says that the behavior is unspecified when duplicate names										
      are given, or if the source of one link is the target of another.										
										
      Its examples are updated to match the latest data.										
										
      The definition of white space has been clarified slightly.										
      (Thanks to Michael Deckers.)										
										
    Changes to the 'Theory' file										
										
      There is a new section about the accuracy of the tz database,										
      describing the many ways that errors can creep in, and										
      explaining why so many of the pre-1970 timestamps are wrong or										
      misleading (thanks to Steve Allen, Lester Caine, and Garrett										
      Wollman for discussions that contributed to this).										
										
      The 'Theory' file describes LMT better (this follows a										
      suggestion by Guy Harris).										
										
      It refers to the 2013 edition of POSIX rather than the 2004 edition.										
										
      It's mentioned that excluding 'backward' should not affect the										
      other data, and it suggests at least one zone.tab name per										
      inhabited country (thanks to Stephen Colebourne).										
										
      Some longstanding restrictions on names are documented, e.g.,										
      'America/New_York' precludes 'America/New_York/Bronx'.										
										
      It gives more reasons for the 1970 cutoff.										
										
      It now mentions which time_t variants are supported, such as										
      signed integer time_t.  (Thanks to Paul Goyette for reporting										
      typos in an experimental version of this change.)										
										
      (Thanks to Philip Newton for correcting typos in these changes.)										
										
    Documentation and commentary is more careful to distinguish UT in										
    general from UTC in particular.  (Thanks to Steve Allen.)										
										
    Add a better source for the Zurich 1894 transition.										
    (Thanks to Pierre-Yves Berger.)										
										
    Update shapefile citations in tz-link.htm.  (Thanks to Guy Harris.)										
										
										
Release 2013d - 2013-07-05 07:38:01 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting future timestamps:										
										
    Morocco's midsummer transitions this year are July 7 and August 10,										
    not July 9 and August 8.  (Thanks to Andrew Paprocki.)										
										
    Israel now falls back on the last Sunday of October.										
    (Thanks to Ephraim Silverberg.)										
										
  Changes affecting past timestamps:										
										
"    Specify Jerusalem's location more precisely; this changes the pre-1880"										
    times by 2 s.										
										
  Changing affecting metadata only:										
										
    Fix typos in the entries for country codes BQ and SX.										
										
  Changes affecting code:										
										
    Rework the code to fix a bug with handling Australia/Macquarie on										
    32-bit hosts (thanks to Arthur David Olson).										
										
    Port to platforms like NetBSD, where time_t can be wider than long.										
										
    Add support for testing time_t types other than the system's.										
    Run 'make check_time_t_alternatives' to try this out.										
"    Currently, the tests fail for unsigned time_t;"										
    this should get fixed at some point.										
										
  Changes affecting documentation and commentary:										
										
    Deemphasize the significance of national borders.										
										
    Update the zdump man page.										
										
    Remove obsolete NOID comment (thanks to Denis Excoffier).										
										
    Update several URLs and comments in the web pages.										
										
    Spelling fixes (thanks to Kevin Lyda and Jonathan Leffler).										
										
    Update URL for CLDR Zone->Tzid table (thanks to Yoshito Umaoka).										
										
										
Release 2013c - 2013-04-19 16:17:40 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting current and future timestamps:										
										
    Palestine observed DST starting March 29, 2013.  (Thanks to										
    Steffen Thorsen.)  From 2013 on, Gaza and Hebron both observe DST,										
    with the predicted rules being the last Thursday in March at 24:00										
    to the first Friday on or after September 21 at 01:00.										
										
    Assume that the recent change to Paraguay's DST rules is permanent,										
    by moving the end of DST to the 4th Sunday in March every year.										
    (Thanks to Carlos Raúl Perasso.)										
										
  Changes affecting past timestamps:										
										
    Fix some historical data for Palestine to agree with that of										
    timeanddate.com, as follows:										
										
	  The spring 2008 change in Gaza and Hebron was on 00:00 Mar 28, not									
	  00:00 Apr 1.									
										
	  The fall 2009 change in Gaza and Hebron on Sep 4 was at 01:00, not									
	  02:00.									
										
	  The spring 2010 change in Hebron was 00:00 Mar 26, not 00:01 Mar 27.									
										
	  The spring 2011 change in Gaza was 00:01 Apr 1, not 12:01 Apr 2.									
										
	  The spring 2011 change in Hebron on Apr 1 was at 00:01, not 12:01.									
										
	  The fall 2011 change in Hebron on Sep 30 was at 00:00, not 03:00.									
										
    Fix times of habitation for Macquarie to agree with the Tasmania										
    Parks & Wildlife Service history, which indicates that permanent										
    habitation was 1899-1919 and 1948 on.										
										
  Changing affecting metadata only:										
										
    Macquarie Island is politically part of Australia, not Antarctica.										
    (Thanks to Tobias Conradi.)										
										
    Sort Macquarie more-consistently with other parts of Australia.										
    (Thanks to Tim Parenti.)										
										
										
Release 2013b - 2013-03-10 22:33:40 -0700										
										
  Changes affecting current and future timestamps:										
										
    Haiti uses US daylight-saving rules this year, and presumably future years.										
    This changes timestamps starting today.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
    Paraguay will end DST on March 24 this year.										
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)  For now, assume it's just this year.										
										
"    Morocco does not observe DST during Ramadan;"										
    try to predict Ramadan in Morocco as best we can.										
    (Thanks to Erik Homoet for the heads-up.)										
										
  Changes affecting commentary:										
										
    Update URLs in tz-link page.  Add URLs for webOS, BB10, iOS.										
    Update URL for Solaris.  Mention Internet RFC 6557.										
    Update Internet RFCs 2445->5545, 2822->5322.										
    Switch from FTP to HTTP for Internet RFCs.										
										
										
Release 2013a - 2013-02-27 09:20:35 -0800										
										
  Change affecting binary data format:										
										
    The zone offset at the end of version-2-format zone files is now										
    allowed to be 24:00, as per POSIX.1-2008.  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)										
										
  Changes affecting current and future timestamps:										
										
    Chile's 2013 rules, and we guess rules for 2014 and later, will be										
    the same as 2012, namely Apr Sun>=23 03:00 UTC to Sep Sun>=2 04:00 UTC.										
    (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen and Robert Elz.)										
										
    New Zones Asia/Khandyga, Asia/Ust-Nera, Europe/Busingen.										
    (Thanks to Tobias Conradi and Arthur David Olson.)										
										
  Many changes affect historical timestamps before 1940.										
  These were deduced from: Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899										
"  Feb;13(2):173-94 <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359>."										
										
  Changes affecting the code:										
										
    Fix zic bug that mishandled Egypt's 2010 changes (this also affected										
    the data).  (Thanks to Arthur David Olson.)										
										
    Fix localtime bug when time_t is unsigned and data files were generated										
    by a signed time_t system.  (Thanks to Doug Bailey for reporting and										
    to Arthur David Olson for fixing.)

Release 2012j - 2012-11-12 18:34:49 -0800										
										
  Libya moved to CET this weekend, but with DST planned next year.										
  (Thanks to Even Scharning, Steffen Thorsen, and Tim Parenti.)										
										
  Signatures now have the extension .asc, not .sign, as that's more										
  standard.  (Thanks to Phil Pennock.)										
										
  The output of 'zdump --version', and of 'zic --version', now										
  uses a format that is more typical for --version.										
  (Thanks to Joseph S. Myers.)										
										
  The output of 'tzselect --help', 'zdump --help', and 'zic --help'										
  now uses tz@iana.org rather than the old elsie address.										
										
  zic -v now complains about abbreviations that are less than 3										
  or more than 6 characters, as per Posix.  Formerly, it checked										
  for abbreviations that were more than 3.										
										
  'make public' no longer puts its temporary directory under /tmp,										
  and uses the just-built zic rather than the system zic.										
										
  Various fixes to documentation and commentary.										
										
										
Release 2012i - 2012-11-03 12:57:09 -0700										
										
  Cuba switches from DST tomorrow at 01:00.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
  Linker flags can now be specified via LDFLAGS.										
  AWK now defaults to 'awk', not 'nawk'.										
  The shell in tzselect now defaults to /bin/bash, but this can										
  be overridden by specifying KSHELL.										
  The main web page now mentions the unofficial GitHub repository.										
  (Thanks to Mike Frysinger.)										
										
  Tarball signatures can now be built by running 'make signatures'.										
  There are also new makefile rules 'tarballs', 'check_public', and										
  separate makefile rules for each tarball and signature file.										
  A few makefile rules are now more portable to strict POSIX.										
										
  The main web page now lists the canonical IANA URL.										
										
										
Release 2012h - 2012-10-26 22:49:10 -0700

  Israel has new DST rules next year.  (Thanks to Ephraim Silverberg.)										
										
  Jordan stays on DST this winter.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
  Web page updates.										
										
  More C modernization, except that at Arthur David Olson's suggestion										
  the instances of 'register' were kept.										
										
										
Release 2012g - 2012-10-17 20:59:45 -0700										
										
  Samoa fall 2012 and later.  (Thanks to Nicholas Pereira and Robert Elz.)										
										
  Palestine fall 2012.  (Thanks to Steffen Thorsen.)										
										
  Assume C89.										
										
  To attack the version-number problem, this release ships the file										
  'Makefile' (which contains the release number) in both the tzcode and										
  the tzdata tarballs.  The two Makefiles are identical, and should be										
  identical in any matching pair of tarballs, so it shouldn't matter										
  which order you extract the tarballs.  Perhaps we can come up with a										
"  better version-number scheme at some point; this scheme does have the"										
  virtue of not adding more files.										
										
										
Release 2012f - 2012-09-12 23:17:03 -0700

Release code2012c-data2012d - 2012-07-19 16:35:33 -0700										
										
  Changes for Morocco's timestamps, which take effect in a couple of										
  hours, along with infrastructure changes to accommodate how the tz										
  code and data are released on IANA.										
										
										
Release data2012c - 2012-03-27 12:17:25 -0400										
										
  africa										
	Summer time changes for Morocco (to start late April 2012)									
										
  asia										
	Changes for 2012 for Gaza & the West Bank (Hebron) and Syria									
										
  northamerica										
	Haiti following US/Canada rules for 2012 (and we're assuming,									
	for now anyway, for the future).									
										
										
Release 2012b - 2012-03-02 12:29:15 +0700										
										
  There is just one change to tzcode2012b (compared with 2012a):										
  the Makefile that was accidentally included with 2012a has been										
  replaced with the version that should have been there, which is										
  identical with the previous version (from tzcode2011i).										
										
  There are just two changes in tzdata2012b compared with 2012a.										
										
  Most significantly, summer time in Cuba has been delayed 3 weeks										
  (now starts April 1 rather than March 11).   Since Mar 11 (the old start										
  date, as listed in 2012a) is just a little over a week away, this										
  change is urgent.										
										
  Less importantly, an excess tab in one of the changes in zone.tab										
  in 2012a has been removed.										
										
										
Release 2012a - 2012-03-01 18:28:10 +0700										
										
  The changes in tzcode2012a (compared to the previous version, 2011i)										
  are entirely to the README and tz-art.htm and tz-link.htm files, if										
  none of those concern you, you can ignore the code update.  The changes										
  reflect the changed addresses for the mailing list and the code and										
  data distribution points & methods (and a link to DateTime::TimeZone::Tzfile										
  has been added to tz-link.htm).										
										
  In tzdata2012a (compared to the previous release, which was 2011n)										
  the major changes are:										
	Chile 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 summer time date adjustments.									
	Falkland Islands onto permanent summer time (we're assuming for the									
		foreseeable future, though 2012 is all we're fairly certain of.)								
	Armenia has abolished Summer Time.									
	Tokelau jumped the International Date Line back last December									
		(just the same as their near neighbour, Samoa).								
	America/Creston is a new zone for a small area of British Columbia									
	There will be a leapsecond 2012-06-30 23:59:60 UTC.									
										
  Other minor changes are:										
	Corrections to 1918 Canadian summer time end dates.									
	Updated URL for UK time zone history (in comments)									
	A few typos in Le Corre's list of free French place names (comments)									
										
										
Release data2011n - 2011-10-30 14:57:54 +0700										
										
  There are three changes of note - most urgently, Cuba (America/Havana)										
  has extended summer time by two weeks, now to end on Nov 13, rather than										
  the (already past) Oct 30.   Second, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic										
  (Europe/Tiraspol) decided not to split from the rest of Moldova after										
  all, and consequently that zone has been removed (again) and reinstated										
"  in the ""backward"" file as a link to Europe/Chisinau.   And third, the"										
  end date for Fiji's summer time this summer was moved forward from the										
  earlier planned Feb 26, to Jan 22.										
										
  Apart from that, Moldova (MD) returns to a single entry in zone.tab										
  (and the incorrect syntax that was in the 2011m version of that file										
  is so fixed - it would have been fixed in a different way had this										
"  change not happened - that's the ""missing"" sccs version id)."										
										
										
Release data2011m - 2011-10-24 21:42:16 +0700										
										
  In particular, the typos in comments in the data (2011-11-17 should have										
  been 2011-10-17 as Alan Barrett noted, and spelling of Tiraspol that										
  Tim Parenti noted) have been fixed, and the change for Ukraine has been										
  made in all 4 Ukrainian zones, rather than just Kiev (again, thanks to										
  Tim Parenti, and also Denys Gavrysh)										
										
  In addition, I added Europe/Tiraspol to zone.tab.										
										
  This time, all the files have new version numbers...  (including the files										
  otherwise unchanged in 2011m that were changed in 2011l but didn't get new										
  version numbers there...)										
										
										
Release data2011l - 2011-10-10 11:15:43 +0700										
										
  There are just 2 changes that cause different generated tzdata files from										
  zic, to Asia/Hebron and Pacific/Fiji - the possible change for Bahia, Brazil										
  is included, but commented out.  Compared with the diff I sent out last week,										
  this version also includes attributions for the sources for the changes										
  (in much the same format as ado used, but the html tags have not been										
  checked, verified, or used in any way at all, so if there are errors there,										
  please let me know.)

  [tzcode96f.tar.gz + tzdata96g.tar.gz are both missing!]										
										
  The changes get us some of the way to fixing the problems noted in Paul										
  Eggert's letter yesterday (in addition to a few others).  The approach										
  has been to make zic a bit smarter about figuring out what time zone										
"  abbreviations apply just after the time specified in the ""UNTIL"" part"										
  of a zone line.  Putting the smarts in zic means avoiding having										
"  transition times show up in both ""Zone"" lines and ""Rule"" lines, which"										
  in turn avoids multiple transition time entries in time zone files.										
"  (This also makes the zic input files such as ""europe"" a bit shorter and"										
  should ease maintenance.)

Release 94b - 1994-02-07 10:04:33 -0500										
										
  work by Paul Eggert who notes:										
										
"  I found another book of time zone histories by E W Whitman; it's not"										
  as extensive as Shanks but has a few goodies of its own.  I used it										
  to update the tables.  I also fixed some more as a result of										
  correspondence with Adam David and Peter Ilieve, and move some stray										
  links from 'europe' to 'backward'.  I corrected some scanning errors										
  in usno1989.										
										
  As far as the code goes, I fixed zic to allow years in the range										
"  INT_MIN to INT_MAX; this fixed a few boundary conditions around 1900."										
  And I cleaned up the zic documentation a little bit.										
										
										
Release data94a - 1994-02-03 08:58:54 -0500

"  updated ""leapseconds"" file"										
										
										
Release 93 - 1993-01-08 07:01:06 -0500										
										
  At kre's suggestion, the package has been split in two - a code piece										
  (which also includes documentation) that's only of use to folks who										
  want to recompile things and a data piece useful to anyone who can										
"  run ""zic""."										
										
  The new version has a few changes to the data files, a few										
  portability changes, and an off-by-one fix (with thanks to										
  Tom Karzes at deshaw.com for providing a description and a										
  solution).										
										
										
Release 92c - 1992-11-21 17:35:36 -0000										
  [tz92c.tar.Z is missing!]										
										
  The fallout from the latest round of DST transitions.										
										
"  There are changes for Portugal, Saskatchewan, and ""Pacific-New"";"										
"  there's also a change to ""zic.c"" that makes it portable to more systems."										
										
										
Release 92 - 1992-04-25 18:17:03 -0000										
  [tz92.tar.Z is missing!]										
										
  By popular demand (well, at any rate, following a request by kre at munnari)										
										
										
The 1989 update of the time zone package featured:										
										
  *	POSIXization (including interpretation of POSIX-style TZ environment									
	variables, provided by Guy Harris),									
  *	"ANSIfication (including versions of ""mktime"" and ""difftime""),"									
  *	"SVIDulation (an ""altzone"" variable)"									
  *	"MACHination (the ""gtime"" function)"									
  *	corrections to some time zone data (including corrections to the rules									
	for Great Britain and New Zealand)									
  *	reference data from the United States Naval Observatory for folks who									
	want to do additional time zones									
  *	and the 1989 data for Saudi Arabia.									
										
"  (Since this code will be treated as ""part of the implementation"" in some"										
"  places and as ""part of the application"" in others, there's no good way to"										
  name functions, such as timegm, that are not part of the proposed ANSI C										
"  standard; such functions have kept their old, underscore-free names in this"										
  update.)										
										
"  And the ""dysize"" function has disappeared; it was present to allow"										
"  compilation of the ""date"" command on old BSD systems, and a version of ""date"""										
"  is now provided in the package.  The ""date"" command is not created when you"										
"  ""make all"" since it may lack options provided by the version distributed with"										
  your operating system, or may not interact with the system in the same way										
  the native version does.										
										
  Since POSIX frowns on correct leap second handling, the default behavior of										
"  the ""zic"" command (in the absence of a ""-L"" option) has been changed to omit"										
  leap second information from its output files.

Notes										
										
This file contains copies of the part of each release announcement										
that talks about the changes in that release.  The text has been										
adapted and reformatted for the purposes of this file.										
										
Traditionally a release R consists of a pair of tarball files,										
tzcodeR.tar.gz and tzdataR.tar.gz.  However, some releases (e.g.,										
code2010a, data2012c) consist of just one or the other tarball, and a										
few (e.g., code2012c-data2012d) have tarballs with mixed version										
numbers.  Recent releases also come in an experimental format										
consisting of a single tarball tzdb-R.tar.lz with extra data.										
										
Release timestamps are taken from the release's commit (for newer,										
Git-based releases), from the newest file in the tarball (for older										
releases, where this info is available) or from the email announcing										
"the release (if all else fails; these are marked with a time zone of"										
"-0000 and an ""is missing!"" comment)."										
										
Earlier versions of the code and data were not announced on the tz										
list and are not summarized here.

The Time Zone Database (often called tz or zoneinfo) contains code and										
data that represent the history of local time for many representative										
locations around the globe.  It is updated periodically to reflect										
changes made by political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets,										
and daylight-saving rules.										
										
See <https://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/tz-link.html> or the										
file tz-link.htm for how to acquire the code and data.  Once acquired,										
read the comments in the file 'Makefile' and make any changes needed										
to make things right for your system, especially if you are using some										
platform other than GNU/Linux.  Then run the following commands,										
"substituting your desired installation directory for ""$HOME/tzdir"":"										
										
	make TOPDIR=$HOME/tzdir install									
	$HOME/tzdir/etc/zdump -v America/Los_Angeles									
										
Historical local time information has been included here to:										
										
*	provide a compendium of data about the history of civil time									
	"that is useful even if not 100% accurate;"									
										
*	give an idea of the variety of local time rules that have									
	existed in the past and thus an idea of the variety that may be									
	"expected in the future;"									
										
*	provide a test of the generality of the local time rule description									
	system.									
										
"The information in the time zone data files is by no means authoritative;"										
fixes and enhancements are welcome.  Please see the file CONTRIBUTING										
for details.										
										
Thanks to these Time Zone Caballeros who've made major contributions to the

Michael Bloom, Art Neilson, Stephen Prince, John Sovereign, and Frank Wales										
for testing work, and to Gwillim Law for checking local mean time data.										
Thanks in particular to Arthur David Olson, the project's founder and first

"    <h2 id=""scope"">Scope of the tz database</h2>"										
<p>										
The tz database attempts to record the history and predicted future of										
all computer-based clocks that track civil time.  To represent this										
data, the world is partitioned into regions whose clocks all agree										
about timestamps that occur after the somewhat-arbitrary cutoff point										
of the POSIX Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).  For each such region,										
the database records all known clock transitions, and labels the region										
with a notable location.  Although 1970 is a somewhat-arbitrary										
cutoff, there are significant challenges to moving the cutoff earlier										
even by a decade or two, due to the wide variety of local practices										
before computer timekeeping became prevalent.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
Clock transitions before 1970 are recorded for each such location,										
because most systems support timestamps before 1970 and could										
misbehave if data entries were omitted for pre-1970 transitions.										
However, the database is not designed for and does not suffice for										
applications requiring accurate handling of all past times everywhere,										
as it would take far too much effort and guesswork to record all										
details of pre-1970 civil timekeeping.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
As described below, reference source code for using the tz database is										
also available.  The tz code is upwards compatible with POSIX, an										
international standard for UNIX-like systems.  As of this writing, the										
current edition of POSIX is:										
"  <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/"">"										
  The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7</a>,										
  IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016 Edition.										
</p>										
  </section>										
										
										
										
  <section>										
"    <h2 id=""naming"">Names of time zone rules</h2>"										
<p>										
Each of the database's time zone rules has a unique name.										
Inexperienced users are not expected to select these names unaided.										
Distributors should provide documentation and/or a simple selection										
"interface that explains the names; for one example, see the 'tzselect'"

"<a href=""http://cldr.unicode.org/"">Unicode Common Locale Data"										
Repository</a> contains data that may be useful for other										
selection interfaces.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
The time zone rule naming conventions attempt to strike a balance										
among the following goals:										
</p>										
<ul>										
  <li>										
   Uniquely identify every region where clocks have agreed since 1970.										
   This is essential for the intended use: static clocks keeping local										
   civil time.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Indicate to experts where that region is.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Be robust in the presence of political changes.  For example, names										
   of countries are ordinarily not used, to avoid incompatibilities										
"   when countries change their name (e.g. Zaire&rarr;Congo) or when"										
   locations change countries (e.g. Hong Kong from UK colony to										
   China).										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Be portable to a wide variety of implementations.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Use a consistent naming conventions over the entire world.										
  </li>										
</ul>										
<p>										
Names normally have the										
form <var>AREA</var><code>/</code><var>LOCATION</var>,										
where <var>AREA</var> is the name of a continent or ocean,										
and <var>LOCATION</var> is the name of a specific										
location within that region.  North and South America share the same										
area, '<code>America</code>'.  Typical names are										
'<code>Africa/Cairo</code>', '<code>America/New_York</code>', and										
'<code>Pacific/Honolulu</code>'.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
Here are the general rules used for choosing location names,										
in decreasing order of importance:										
</p>										
<ul>										
  <li>										
	Use only valid POSIX file name components (i.e., the parts of									
		names other than '<code>/</code>').  Do not use the file name								
		components '<code>.</code>' and '<code>..</code>'.								
		Within a file name component,								
		use only ASCII letters, '<code>.</code>',								
		'<code>-</code>' and '<code>_</code>'.  Do not use								
		digits, as that might create an ambiguity with POSIX								
		TZ strings.  A file name component must not exceed 14								
		characters or start with '<code>-</code>'.  E.g.,								
		prefer '<code>Brunei</code>' to								
		'<code>Bandar_Seri_Begawan</code>'.  Exceptions: see								
		the discussion								
		of legacy names below.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	A name must not be empty, or contain '<code>//</code>', or									
	start or end with '<code>/</code>'.									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Do not use names that differ only in case.  Although the reference									
		implementation is case-sensitive, some other implementations								
		are not, and they would mishandle names differing only in case.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	If one name <var>A</var> is an initial prefix of another									
		name <var>AB</var> (ignoring case), then <var>B</var>								
		must not start with '<code>/</code>', as a								
		regular file cannot have								
		the same name as a directory in POSIX.  For example,								
		'<code>America/New_York</code>' precludes								
		'<code>America/New_York/Bronx</code>'.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Uninhabited regions like the North Pole and Bouvet Island									
		do not need locations, since local time is not defined there.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	There should typically be at least one name for each ISO 3166-1									
		officially assigned two-letter code for an inhabited country								
		or territory.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	If all the clocks in a region have agreed since 1970,									
		don't bother to include more than one location								
		even if subregions' clocks disagreed before 1970.								
		Otherwise these tables would become annoyingly large.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	"If a name is ambiguous, use a less ambiguous alternative;"									
		e.g. many cities are named San José and Georgetown, so								
		prefer '<code>Costa_Rica</code>' to '<code>San_Jose</code>' and '<code>Guyana</code>' to '<code>Georgetown</code>'.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Keep locations compact.  Use cities or small islands, not countries									
		or regions, so that any future time zone changes do not split								
		locations into different time zones.  E.g. prefer								
		'<code>Paris</code>' to '<code>France</code>', since								
		France has had multiple time zones.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Use mainstream English spelling, e.g. prefer									
		'<code>Rome</code>' to '<code>Roma</code>', and prefer								
		'<code>Athens</code>' to the Greek								
		'<code>Αθήνα</code>' or the Romanized								
		'<code>Athína</code>'.								
		The POSIX file name restrictions encourage this rule.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Use the most populous among locations in a zone,									
		e.g. prefer '<code>Shanghai</code>' to								
		'<code>Beijing</code>'.  Among locations with								
		similar populations, pick the best-known location,								
		e.g. prefer '<code>Rome</code>' to '<code>Milan</code>'.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Use the singular form, e.g. prefer '<code>Canary</code>' to '<code>Canaries</code>'.									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Omit common suffixes like '<code>_Islands</code>' and									
		'<code>_City</code>', unless that would lead to								
		ambiguity.  E.g. prefer '<code>Cayman</code>' to								
		'<code>Cayman_Islands</code>' and								
		'<code>Guatemala</code>' to								
		'<code>Guatemala_City</code>', but prefer								
		'<code>Mexico_City</code>' to '<code>Mexico</code>'								
		because the country								
		of Mexico has several time zones.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Use '<code>_</code>' to represent a space.									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Omit '<code>.</code>' from abbreviations in names, e.g. prefer									
		'<code>St_Helena</code>' to '<code>St._Helena</code>'.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Do not change established names if they only marginally									
		violate the above rules.  For example, don't change								
		the existing name '<code>Rome</code>' to								
		'<code>Milan</code>' merely because								
		Milan's population has grown to be somewhat greater								
		than Rome's.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	If a name is changed, put its old spelling in the									
		'<code>backward</code>' file.								
		This means old spellings will continue to work.								
  </li>										
</ul>										
										
<p>										
The file '<code>zone1970.tab</code>' lists geographical locations used										
to name time										
zone rules.  It is intended to be an exhaustive list of names for										
"geographic regions as described above; this is a subset of the names"										
in the data.  Although a '<code>zone1970.tab</code>' location's longitude										
corresponds to its LMT offset with one hour for every 15 degrees east										
longitude, this relationship is not exact.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
Older versions of this package used a different naming scheme,										
and these older names are still supported.										
See the file '<code>backward</code>' for most of these older names										
(e.g., '<code>US/Eastern</code>' instead of '<code>America/New_York</code>').										
The other old-fashioned names still supported are										
'<code>WET</code>', '<code>CET</code>', '<code>MET</code>', and '<code>EET</code>' (see the file '<code>europe</code>').										
</p>										
										
<p>										
Older versions of this package defined legacy names that are										
incompatible with the first rule of location names, but which are										
still supported.  These legacy names are mostly defined in the file										
'<code>etcetera</code>'.  Also, the file '<code>backward</code>' defines the legacy names										
'<code>GMT0</code>', '<code>GMT-0</code>' and '<code>GMT+0</code>', and the file '<code>northamerica</code>' defines the										
legacy names '<code>EST5EDT</code>', '<code>CST6CDT</code>', '<code>MST7MDT</code>', and '<code>PST8PDT</code>'.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
Excluding '<code>backward</code>' should not affect the other data.  If										
'<code>backward</code>' is excluded, excluding '<code>etcetera</code>' should not affect the										
remaining data.

  <section>										
"    <h2 id=""abbreviations"">Time zone abbreviations</h2>"										
<p>										
When this package is installed, it generates time zone abbreviations										
like '<code>EST</code>' to be compatible with human tradition and POSIX.										
Here are the general rules used for choosing time zone abbreviations,										
in decreasing order of importance:										
<ul>										
  <li>										
	Use three or more characters that are ASCII alphanumerics or									
		'<code>+</code>' or '<code>-</code>'.								
		Previous editions of this database also used characters like								
		'<code> </code>' and '<code>?</code>', but these								
		characters have a special meaning to								
		the shell and cause commands like								
			'<code>set `date`</code>'							
		to have unexpected effects.								
		Previous editions of this rule required upper-case letters,								
		but the Congressman who introduced Chamorro Standard Time								
		"preferred ""ChST"", so lower-case letters are now allowed."								
		Also, POSIX from 2001 on relaxed the rule to allow								
		'<code>-</code>', '<code>+</code>',								
		and alphanumeric characters from the portable character set								
		in the current locale.  In practice ASCII alphanumerics and								
		'<code>+</code>' and '<code>-</code>' are safe in all locales.								
										
		In other words, in the C locale the POSIX extended regular								
		expression <code>[-+[:alnum:]]{3,}</code> should match								
		the abbreviation.								
		This guarantees that all abbreviations could have been								
		specified by a POSIX TZ string.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Use abbreviations that are in common use among English-speakers,									
		e.g. 'EST' for Eastern Standard Time in North America.								
		We assume that applications translate them to other languages								
		"as part of the normal localization process; for example,"								
		a French application might translate 'EST' to 'HNE'.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	For zones whose times are taken from a city's longitude, use the									
		traditional <var>x</var>MT notation, e.g. 'PMT' for								
		Paris Mean Time.								
		The only name like this in current use is 'GMT'.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Use 'LMT' for local mean time of locations before the introduction									
		"of standard time; see ""<a href=""#scope"">Scope of the"								
		"tz database</a>""."								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	If there is no common English abbreviation, use numeric offsets like									
		<code>-</code>05 and <code>+</code>0830 that are								
		generated by zic's <code>%z</code> notation.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Use current abbreviations for older timestamps to avoid confusion.									
		For example, in 1910 a common English abbreviation for UT +01								
		"in central Europe was 'MEZ' (short for both ""Middle European"								
		"Zone"" and for ""Mitteleuropäische Zeit"" in German).  Nowadays"								
		"'CET' (""Central European Time"") is more common in English, and"								
		the database uses 'CET' even for circa-1910 timestamps as this								
		is less confusing for modern users and avoids the need for								
		determining when 'CET' supplanted 'MEZ' in common usage.								
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Use a consistent style in a zone's history.  For example, if a zone's									
		history tends to use numeric abbreviations and a particular								
		entry could go either way, use a numeric abbreviation.								
  </li>										
</ul>										
    [The remaining guidelines predate the introduction of <code>%z</code>.										
    They are problematic as they mean tz data entries invent										
    notation rather than record it.  These guidelines are now										
    deprecated and the plan is to gradually move to <code>%z</code> for										
"    inhabited locations and to ""<code>-</code>00"" for uninhabited locations.]"										
<ul>										
  <li>										
	If there is no common English abbreviation, abbreviate the English									
		translation of the usual phrase used by native speakers.								
		If this is not available or is a phrase mentioning the country								
		"(e.g. ""Cape Verde Time""), then:"								
	<ul>									
	  <li>									
		When a country is identified with a single or principal zone,								
			append 'T' to the country's ISO	code, e.g. 'CVT' for						
			"Cape Verde Time.  For summer time append 'ST';"							
			"for double summer time append 'DST'; etc."							
	  </li>									
	  <li>									
		Otherwise, take the first three letters of an English place								
			name identifying each zone and append 'T', 'ST', etc.							
			"as before; e.g. 'CHAST' for CHAtham Summer Time."							
	  </li>									
	</ul>									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	Use UT (with time zone abbreviation '<code>-</code>00') for									
		locations while uninhabited.  The leading								
		'<code>-</code>' is a flag that the time								
		"zone is in some sense undefined; this notation is"								
		derived from Internet RFC 3339.								
  </li>										
</ul>										
<p>										
Application writers should note that these abbreviations are ambiguous										
in practice: e.g. 'CST' has a different meaning in China than										
it does in the United States.  In new applications, it's often better										
to use numeric UT offsets like '<code>-</code>0600' instead of time zone										
"abbreviations like 'CST'; this avoids the ambiguity."										
</p>										
  </section>										
										
										
  <section>										
"    <h2 id=""accuracy"">Accuracy of the tz database</h2>"										
<p>										
The tz database is not authoritative, and it surely has errors.										
"Corrections are welcome and encouraged; see the file CONTRIBUTING."										
Users requiring authoritative data should consult national standards										
bodies and the references cited in the database's comments.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
Errors in the tz database arise from many sources:										
</p>										
<ul>										
  <li>										
   The tz database predicts future timestamps, and current predictions										
   will be incorrect after future governments change the rules.										
   For example, if today someone schedules a meeting for 13:00 next										
   October 1, Casablanca time, and tomorrow Morocco changes its										
   daylight saving rules, software can mess up after the rule change										
   if it blithely relies on conversions made before the change.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   The pre-1970 entries in this database cover only a tiny sliver of how										
"   clocks actually behaved; the vast majority of the necessary"										
   information was lost or never recorded.  Thousands more zones would										
   be needed if the tz database's scope were extended to cover even										
"   just the known or guessed history of standard time; for example,"										
   the current single entry for France would need to split into dozens										
   of entries, perhaps hundreds.  And in most of the world even this										
   approach would be misleading due to widespread disagreement or										
   indifference about what times should be observed.  In her 2015 book										
   <cite>The Global Transformation of Time, 1870-1950</cite>, Vanessa Ogle writes										
"   ""Outside of Europe and North America there was no system of time"										
   zones at all, often not even a stable landscape of mean times,										
"   prior to the middle decades of the twentieth century"".  See:"										
   Timothy Shenk, <a										
"   href=""https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/booked-a-global-history-of-time-vanessa-ogle"">Booked:"										
   A Global History of Time</a>. <cite>Dissent</cite> 2015-12-17.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Most of the pre-1970 data entries come from unreliable sources, often										
   astrology books that lack citations and whose compilers evidently										
   invented entries when the true facts were unknown, without										
   reporting which entries were known and which were invented.										
   These books often contradict each other or give implausible entries,										
   and on the rare occasions when they are checked they are										
   typically found to be incorrect.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   For the UK the tz database relies on years of first-class work done by										
"   Joseph Myers and others; see"										
"   ""<a href=""https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/"">History of"										
"   legal time in Britain</a>""."										
   Other countries are not done nearly as well.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Sometimes, different people in the same city would maintain clocks										
   that differed significantly.  Railway time was used by railroad										
   companies (which did not always agree with each other),										
   church-clock time was used for birth certificates, etc.										
   Often this was merely common practice, but sometimes it was set by law.										
   For example, from 1891 to 1911 the UT offset in France was legally										
   0:09:21 outside train stations and 0:04:21 inside.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Although a named location in the tz database stands for the										
   containing region, its pre-1970 data entries are often accurate for										
   only a small subset of that region.  For example, <code>Europe/London</code>										
   stands for the United Kingdom, but its pre-1847 times are valid										
   only for locations that have London's exact meridian, and its 1847										
"   transition to GMT is known to be valid only for the L&amp;NW and the"										
   Caledonian railways.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   The tz database does not record the earliest time for which a zone's										
   data entries are thereafter valid for every location in the region.										
   For example, <code>Europe/London</code> is valid for all locations in its										
   region after GMT was made the standard time, but the date of										
   standardization (1880-08-02) is not in the tz database, other than										
   in commentary.  For many zones the earliest time of validity is										
   unknown.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   The tz database does not record a region's boundaries, and in many										
   cases the boundaries are not known.  For example, the zone										
   <code>America/Kentucky/Louisville</code> represents a region around										
   the city of										
   Louisville, the boundaries of which are unclear.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Changes that are modeled as instantaneous transitions in the tz										
   database were often spread out over hours, days, or even decades.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Even if the time is specified by law, locations sometimes										
   deliberately flout the law.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Early timekeeping practices, even assuming perfect clocks, were										
   often not specified to the accuracy that the tz database requires.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Sometimes historical timekeeping was specified more precisely										
   than what the tz database can handle.  For example, from 1909 to										
   1937 Netherlands clocks were legally UT +00:19:32.13, but the tz										
   database cannot represent the fractional second.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Even when all the timestamp transitions recorded by the tz database										
   are correct, the tz rules that generate them may not faithfully										
   reflect the historical rules.  For example, from 1922 until World										
   War II the UK moved clocks forward the day following the third										
   Saturday in April unless that was Easter, in which case it moved										
   clocks forward the previous Sunday.  Because the tz database has no										
   way to specify Easter, these exceptional years are entered as										
   separate tz Rule lines, even though the legal rules did not change.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   The tz database models pre-standard time using the proleptic Gregorian										
   calendar and local mean time (LMT), but many people used other										
   calendars and other timescales.  For example, the Roman Empire used										
   the Julian calendar, and had 12 varying-length daytime hours with a										
   non-hour-based system at night.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Early clocks were less reliable, and data entries do not represent										
   clock error.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   The tz database assumes Universal Time (UT) as an origin, even										
   though UT is not standardized for older timestamps.  In the tz										
   database commentary, UT denotes a family of time standards that										
   includes Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) along with other variants										
   such as UT1 and GMT, with days starting at midnight.  Although UT										
   equals UTC for modern timestamps, UTC was not defined until 1960,										
   so commentary uses the more-general abbreviation UT for timestamps										
   that might predate 1960.  Since UT, UT1, etc. disagree slightly,										
   and since pre-1972 UTC seconds varied in length, interpretation of										
   older timestamps can be problematic when subsecond accuracy is										
   needed.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   Civil time was not based on atomic time before 1972, and we don't										
   know the history of earth's rotation accurately enough to map SI										
   seconds to historical solar time to more than about one-hour										
   accuracy.  See: Stephenson FR, Morrison LV, Hohenkerk CY.										
"   <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2016.0404"">Measurement"										
   of the Earth's rotation: 720 BC to AD 2015</a>.										
"   <cite>Proc Royal Soc A</cite>. 2016 Dec 7;472:20160404."										
   Also see: Espenak F. <a										
"   href=""https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/uncertainty2004.html"">Uncertainty"										
   in Delta T (ΔT)</a>.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   The relationship between POSIX time (that is, UTC but ignoring leap										
   seconds) and UTC is not agreed upon after 1972.  Although the POSIX										
   clock officially stops during an inserted leap second, at least one										
"   proposed standard has it jumping back a second instead; and in"										
   practice POSIX clocks more typically either progress glacially during										
   a leap second, or are slightly slowed while near a leap second.										
  </li>										
  <li>										
   The tz database does not represent how uncertain its information is.										
   Ideally it would contain information about when data entries are										
   incomplete or dicey.  Partial temporal knowledge is a field of										
   active research, though, and it's not clear how to apply it here.										
  </li>										
</ul>										
<p>										
In short, many, perhaps most, of the tz database's pre-1970 and future										
timestamps are either wrong or misleading.  Any attempt to pass the										
tz database off as the definition of time should be unacceptable to										
anybody who cares about the facts.  In particular, the tz database's										
LMT offsets should not be considered meaningful, and should not prompt										
creation of zones merely because two locations differ in LMT or										
transitioned to standard time at different dates.										
</p>										
  </section>										
										
										
  <section>										
"    <h2 id=""functions"">Time and date functions</h2>"										
<p>										
The tz code contains time and date functions that are upwards										
compatible with those of POSIX.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
POSIX has the following properties and limitations.										
</p>										
<ul>										
  <li>										
    <p>										
	In POSIX, time display in a process is controlled by the									
	environment variable TZ.  Unfortunately, the POSIX TZ string takes									
	a form that is hard to describe and is error-prone in practice.									
	Also, POSIX TZ strings can't deal with other (for example, Israeli)									
	daylight saving time rules, or situations where more than two									
	time zone abbreviations are used in an area.									
    </p>										
    <p>										
      The POSIX TZ string takes the following form:										
    </p>										
    <p>										
      <var>stdoffset</var>[<var>dst</var>[<var>offset</var>][<code>,</code><var>date</var>[<code>/</code><var>time</var>]<code>,</code><var>date</var>[<code>/</code><var>time</var>]]]										
    </p>										
    <p>										
	where:									
    <dl>										
      <dt><var>std</var> and <var>dst</var></dt><dd>										
		are 3 or more characters specifying the standard								
		and daylight saving time (DST) zone names.								
		Starting with POSIX.1-2001, <var>std</var>								
		and <var>dst</var> may also be								
		"in a quoted form like '<code>&lt;UTC+10&gt;</code>'; this allows"								
		"<code>+</code> and ""<code>-</code>"" in the names."								
      </dd>										
      <dt><var>offset</var></dt><dd>										
		is of the form								
		"'<code>[&plusmn;]<var>hh</var>:[<var>mm</var>[:<var>ss</var>]]</code>'"								
		and specifies the offset west of UT.  '<var>hh</var>'								
		"may be a single digit; 0&le;<var>hh</var>&le;24."								
		The default DST offset is one hour ahead of standard time.								
      </dd>										
      <dt><var>date</var>[<code>/</code><var>time</var>]<code>,</code><var>date</var>[<code>/</code><var>time</var>]</dt><dd>										
		specifies the beginning and end of DST.  If this is absent,								
		the system supplies its own rules for DST, and these can								
		"differ from year to year; typically US DST rules are used."								
      </dd>										
      <dt><var>time</var></dt><dd>										
		takes the form								
		'<var>hh</var><code>:</code>[<var>mm</var>[<code>:</code><var>ss</var>]]'								
		and defaults to 02:00.								
		This is the same format as the offset, except that a

	Here is an example POSIX TZ string for New Zealand after 2007.									
	It says that standard time (NZST) is 12 hours ahead of UTC,									
	and that daylight saving time (NZDT) is observed from September's									
	last Sunday at 02:00 until April's first Sunday at 03:00:									
										
        <pre><code>TZ='NZST-12NZDT,M9.5.0,M4.1.0/3'</code></pre>										
										
	This POSIX TZ string is hard to remember, and mishandles some									
	timestamps before 2008.  With this package you can use this									
	instead:									
										
	<pre><code>TZ='Pacific/Auckland'</code></pre>									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	POSIX does not define the exact meaning of TZ values like									
	<code>EST5EDT</code>.									
	Typically the current US DST rules are used to interpret such values,									
	but this means that the US DST rules are compiled into each program									
	that does time conversion.  This means that when US time conversion									
	rules change (as in the United States in 1987), all programs that									
	do time conversion must be recompiled to ensure proper results.									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	The TZ environment variable is process-global, which makes it hard									
	to write efficient, thread-safe applications that need access									
	to multiple time zones.									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	In POSIX, there's no tamper-proof way for a process to learn the									
	system's best idea of local wall clock.  (This is important for									
	applications that an administrator wants used only at certain									
	"times &ndash;"									
	without regard to whether the user has fiddled the TZ environment									
	"variable.  While an administrator can ""do everything in UTC"" to get"									
	around the problem, doing so is inconvenient and precludes handling									
	daylight saving time shifts - as might be required to limit phone									
	calls to off-peak hours.)									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	POSIX provides no convenient and efficient way to determine the UT									
	offset and time zone abbreviation of arbitrary timestamps,									
	particularly for time zone settings that do not fit into the									
	POSIX model.									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	POSIX requires that systems ignore leap seconds.									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	The tz code attempts to support all the <code>time_t</code>									
	implementations allowed by POSIX.  The <code>time_t</code>									
	type represents a nonnegative count of									
	seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, ignoring leap seconds.									
	In practice, <code>time_t</code> is usually a signed 64- or									
	"32-bit integer; 32-bit signed <code>time_t</code> values stop"									
	working after 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC, so									
	new implementations these days typically use a signed 64-bit integer.									
	Unsigned 32-bit integers are used on one or two platforms,									
	and 36-bit and 40-bit integers are also used occasionally.									
	Although earlier POSIX versions allowed <code>time_t</code> to be a									
	floating-point type, this was not supported by any practical									
	systems, and POSIX.1-2013 and the tz code both									
	require <code>time_t</code>									
	to be an integer type.									
  </li>										
</ul>										
<p>										
These are the extensions that have been made to the POSIX functions:										
</p>										
<ul>										
  <li>										
    <p>										
	The TZ environment variable is used in generating the name of a file									
	from which time zone information is read (or is interpreted a la									
	"POSIX); TZ is no longer constrained to be a three-letter time zone"									
	name followed by a number of hours and an optional three-letter									
	daylight time zone name.  The daylight saving time rules to be used									
	"for a particular time zone are encoded in the time zone file;"									
	the format of the file allows U.S., Australian, and other rules to be									
	encoded, and allows for situations where more than two time zone									
	abbreviations are used.									
    </p>										
    <p>										
	It was recognized that allowing the TZ environment variable to									
	take on values such as '<code>America/New_York</code>' might									
	"cause ""old"" programs"									
	"(that expect TZ to have a certain form) to operate incorrectly;"									
	consideration was given to using some other environment variable									
	(for example, TIMEZONE) to hold the string used to generate the									
	time zone information file name.  In the end, however, it was decided									
	"to continue using TZ: it is widely used for time zone purposes;"									
	"separately maintaining both TZ and TIMEZONE seemed a nuisance;"									
	"and systems where ""new"" forms of TZ might cause problems can simply"									
	"use TZ values such as ""<code>EST5EDT</code>"" which can be used both by"									
	"new programs (a la POSIX) and ""old"" programs (as zone names and"									
	offsets).									
    </p>										
</li>										
<li>										
	The code supports platforms with a UT offset member									
	in <code>struct tm</code>,									
	e.g., <code>tm_gmtoff</code>.									
</li>										
<li>										
	The code supports platforms with a time zone abbreviation member in									
	<code>struct tm</code>, e.g., <code>tm_zone</code>.									
</li>										
<li>										
	Since the TZ environment variable can now be used to control time									
	conversion, the <code>daylight</code>									
	and <code>timezone</code> variables are no longer needed.									
	"(These variables are defined and set by <code>tzset</code>;"									
	however, their values will not be used									
	by <code>localtime</code>.)									
</li>										
<li>										
	Functions <code>tzalloc</code>, <code>tzfree</code>,									
	<code>localtime_rz</code>, and <code>mktime_z</code> for									
	more-efficient thread-safe applications that need to use									
	multiple time zones.  The <code>tzalloc</code>									
	and <code>tzfree</code> functions allocate and free objects of									
	type <code>timezone_t</code>, and <code>localtime_rz</code>									
	and <code>mktime_z</code> are like <code>localtime_r</code>									
	and <code>mktime</code> with an extra									
	<code>timezone_t</code> argument.  The functions were inspired									
	by NetBSD.									
</li>										
<li>										
	A function <code>tzsetwall</code> has been added to arrange									
	for the system's									
	best approximation to local wall clock time to be delivered by									
	subsequent calls to <code>localtime</code>.  Source code for portable									
	"applications that ""must"" run on local wall clock time should call"									
	"<code>tzsetwall</code>; if such code is moved to ""old"" systems that don't"									
	provide tzsetwall, you won't be able to generate an executable program.									
	(These time zone functions also arrange for local wall clock time to be									
	"used if tzset is called &ndash; directly or indirectly &ndash;"									
	and there's no TZ									
	"environment variable; portable applications should not, however, rely"									
	on this behavior since it's not the way SVR2 systems behave.)									
</li>										
<li>										
	Negative <code>time_t</code> values are supported, on systems									
	where <code>time_t</code> is signed.									
</li>										
<li>										
	These functions can account for leap seconds, thanks to Bradley White.									
</li>										
</ul>										
<p>										
Points of interest to folks with other systems:										
</p>										
<ul>										
  <li>										
	Code compatible with this package is already part of many platforms,									
	including GNU/Linux, Android, the BSDs, Chromium OS, Cygwin, AIX, iOS,									
	BlackBery 10, macOS, Microsoft Windows, OpenVMS, and Solaris.									
	On such hosts, the primary use of this package									
	is to update obsolete time zone rule tables.									
	To do this, you may need to compile the time zone compiler									
	'<code>zic</code>' supplied with this package instead of using									
	the system '<code>zic</code>', since the format									
	of <code>zic</code>'s input is occasionally extended, and a									
	platform may still be shipping an older <code>zic</code>.									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	The UNIX Version 7 <code>timezone</code> function is not									
	"present in this package;"									
	"it's impossible to reliably map timezone's arguments (a ""minutes west"									
	"of GMT"" value and a ""daylight saving time in effect"" flag) to a"									
	time zone abbreviation, and we refuse to guess.									
	Programs that in the past used the timezone function may now examine									
	"<code>localtime(&amp;clock)-&gt;tm_zone</code>"									
	(if <code>TM_ZONE</code> is defined) or									
	"<code>tzname[localtime(&amp;clock)-&gt;tm_isdst]</code>"									
	(if <code>HAVE_TZNAME</code> is defined)									
	to learn the correct time zone abbreviation to use.									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	The 4.2BSD <code>gettimeofday</code> function is not used in									
	this package.									
	This formerly let users obtain the current UTC offset and DST flag,									
	but this functionality was removed in later versions of BSD.									
  </li>										
  <li>										
	In SVR2, time conversion fails for near-minimum or near-maximum									
	<code>time_t</code> values when doing conversions for places									
	that don't use UT.									
	This package takes care to do these conversions correctly.									
	A comment in the source code tells how to get compatibly wrong									
	results.									
  </li>										
</ul>										
<p>										
The functions that are conditionally compiled										
if <code>STD_INSPIRED</code> is defined										
should, at this point, be looked on primarily as food for thought.  They are										
"not in any sense ""standard compatible"" &ndash; some are not, in fact,"										
specified in <em>any</em> standard.  They do, however, represent responses of										
various authors to										
standardization proposals.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
Other time conversion proposals, in particular the one developed by folks at										
Hewlett Packard, offer a wider selection of functions that provide capabilities										
beyond those provided here.  The absence of such functions from this package										
is not meant to discourage the development, standardization, or use of such										
functions.  Rather, their absence reflects the decision to make this package										
contain valid extensions to POSIX, to ensure its broad acceptability.  If										
more powerful time conversion functions can be standardized, so much the										
better.

  </li>										
</ul>										
<p>										
Interface changes in a release attempt to preserve compatibility with										
recent releases.  For example, tz data files typically do not rely on										
recently-added <code>zic</code> features, so that users can run										
older <code>zic</code> versions to process newer data										
"files.  <a href=""tz-link.htm"">Sources for time zone and daylight"										
saving time data</a> describes how										
releases are tagged and distributed.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
Interfaces not listed above are less stable.  For example, users										
should not rely on particular UT offsets or abbreviations for										
timestamps, as data entries are often based on guesswork and these										
guesses may be corrected or improved.

"    <h2 id=""calendar"">Calendrical issues</h2>"										
<p>										
Calendrical issues are a bit out of scope for a time zone database,										
but they indicate the sort of problems that we would run into if we										
extended the time zone database further into the past.  An excellent										
resource in this area is Nachum Dershowitz and Edward M. Reingold,										
"<cite><a href=""https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachum/calendar-book/third-edition/"">Calendrical"										
Calculations: Third Edition</a></cite>, Cambridge University Press (2008).

"    <h2 id=""planets"">Time and time zones on other planets</h2>"										
<p>										
Some people's work schedules use Mars time.  Jet Propulsion Laboratory										
(JPL) coordinators have kept Mars time on and off at least since 1997										
for the Mars Pathfinder mission.  Some of their family members have										
also adapted to Mars time.  Dozens of special Mars watches were built										
for JPL workers who kept Mars time during the Mars Exploration										
Rovers mission (2004).  These timepieces look like normal Seikos and										
Citizens but use Mars seconds rather than terrestrial seconds.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
"A Mars solar day is called a ""sol"" and has a mean period equal to"										
about 24 hours 39 minutes 35.244 seconds in terrestrial time.  It is										
divided into a conventional 24-hour clock, so each Mars second equals										
about 1.02749125 terrestrial seconds.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
The prime meridian of Mars goes through the center of the crater										
Airy-0, named in honor of the British astronomer who built the										
Greenwich telescope that defines Earth's prime meridian.  Mean solar										
time on the Mars prime meridian is called Mars Coordinated Time (MTC).										
</p>										
										
<p>										
Each landed mission on Mars has adopted a different reference for										
solar time keeping, so there is no real standard for Mars time zones.										
For example, the Mars Exploration Rover project (2004) defined two										
"time zones ""Local Solar Time A"" and ""Local Solar Time B"" for its two"										
missions, each zone designed so that its time equals local true solar										
"time at approximately the middle of the nominal mission.  Such a ""time"										
"zone"" is not particularly suited for any application other than the"										
mission itself.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
Many calendars have been proposed for Mars, but none have achieved										
wide acceptance.  Astronomers often use Mars Sol Date (MSD) which is a										
sequential count of Mars solar days elapsed since about 1873-12-29										
12:00 GMT.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
In our solar system, Mars is the planet with time and calendar most										
like Earth's.  On other planets, Sun-based time and calendars would										
work quite differently.  For example, although Mercury's sidereal										
rotation period is 58.646 Earth days, Mercury revolves around the Sun										
so rapidly that an observer on Mercury's equator would see a sunrise										
only every 175.97 Earth days, i.e., a Mercury year is 0.5 of a Mercury										
day.  Venus is more complicated, partly because its rotation is										
slightly retrograde: its year is 1.92 of its days.  Gas giants like										
Jupiter are trickier still, as their polar and equatorial regions										
rotate at different rates, so that the length of a day depends on										
latitude.  This effect is most pronounced on Neptune, where the day is										
about 12 hours at the poles and 18 hours at the equator.										
</p>										
										
<p>										
Although the tz database does not support time on other planets, it is										
documented here in the hopes that support will be added eventually.

# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.										
#										
# Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source

# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),										
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries

# Previous editions of this database used WAT, CAT, SAT, and EAT

# but in 1997 Mark R V Murray reported that										
# 'SAST' is the official abbreviation for +02 in the country of South Africa,

# To summarize, the following abbreviations seemed to have some currency:

# than previously announced (2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31).  The new start

#										
# A little strange though, since the article says that they moved the date

#										
# From Lee Hotz (2001-03-08):										
# I queried the folks at Columbia who spent the summer at Vostok and this is										
# what they had to say about time there:										
"# ""in the US Camp (East Camp) we have been on New Zealand (McMurdo)"										
# time, which is 12 hours ahead of GMT. The Russian Station Vostok was										
# 6 hours behind that (although only 2 miles away, i.e. 6 hours ahead										
# of GMT). This is a time zone I think two hours east of Moscow. The										
"# natural time zone is in between the two: 8 hours ahead of GMT."""										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2001-05-04):										
# This seems to be hopelessly confusing, so I asked Lee Hotz about it										
# in person.  He said that some Antarctic locations set their local										
# time so that noon is the warmest part of the day, and that this										
# changes during the year and does not necessarily correspond to mean										
# solar noon.  So the Vostok time might have been whatever the clocks										
# happened to be during their visit.  So we still don't really know what time										
# it is at Vostok.  But we'll guess +06.

# One last quirk about South Pole time.										
# All the electric clocks are usually wrong.										
# Something about the generators running at 60.1hertz or something										
# makes all of the clocks run fast.  So every couple of days,										
# we have to go around and set them back 5 minutes or so.

# From Paul Eggert (2017-01-05):										
# Alois Treindl kindly sent me translations of the following two sources:										
#										
# (1)										
# Guo Qingsheng (National Time-Service Center, CAS, Xi'an 710600, China)										
# Beijing Time at the Beginning of the PRC										
# China Historical Materials of Science and Technology										
# (Zhongguo ke ji shi liao, 中国科技史料), Vol. 24, No. 1 (2003)										
# It gives evidence that at the beginning of the PRC, Beijing time was										
# officially apparent solar time!  However, Guo also says that the										
# evidence is dubious, as the relevant institute of astronomy had not										
# been taken over by the PRC yet.  It's plausible that apparent solar										
# time was announced but never implemented, and that people continued										
# to use UT+8.  As the Shanghai radio station (and I presume the										
# observatory) was still under control of French missionaries, it										
# could well have ignored any such mandate.										
#										
# (2)										
# Guo Qing-sheng (Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory, CAS, Xi'an 710600, China)										
# A Study on the Standard Time Changes for the Past 100 Years in China										
# [undated and unknown publication location]										
# It says several things:										
#   * The Qing dynasty used local apparent solar time throughout China.										
#   * The Republic of China instituted Beijing mean solar time effective										
#     the official calendar book of 1914.										
#   * The French Concession in Shanghai set up signal stations in										
#     French docks in the 1890s, controlled by Xujiahui (Zikawei)										
#     Observatory and set to local mean time.										
"#   * ""From the end of the 19th century"" it changed to UT+8."										
#   * Chinese Customs (by then reduced to a tool of foreign powers)										
#     eventually standardized on this time for all ports, and it										
#     became used by railways as well.										
#   * In 1918 the Central Observatory proposed dividing China into										
#     five time zones (see below for details).  This caught on										
#     at first only in coastal areas observing UT+8.										
#   * During WWII all of China was in theory was at UT+7.  In practice										
#     this was ignored in the west, and I presume was ignored in										
#     Japanese-occupied territory.										
#   * Japanese-occupied Manchuria was at UT+9, i.e., Japan time.										
#   * The five-zone plan was resurrected after WWII and officially put into										
#     place (with some modifications) in March 1948.  It's not clear										
#     how well it was observed in areas under Nationalist control.										
#   * The People's Liberation Army used UT+8 during the civil war.										
#										
"# An AP article ""Shanghai Internat'l Area Little Changed"" in the"										
"# Lewiston (ME) Daily Sun (1939-05-29), p 17, said ""Even the time is"										
# different - the occupied districts going by Tokyo time, an hour										
"# ahead of that prevailing in the rest of Shanghai.""  Guess that the"										
# Xujiahui Observatory was under French control and stuck with UT +08.										
#										
# In earlier versions of this file, China had many separate Zone entries, but										
# this was based on what were apparently incorrect data in Shanks & Pottenger.										
# This has now been simplified to the two entries Asia/Shanghai and										
# Asia/Urumqi, with the others being links for backward compatibility.										
# Proposed in 1918 and theoretically in effect until 1949 (although in practice										
# mainly observed in coastal areas), the five zones were:										
#										
"# Changbai Time (""Long-white Time"", Long-white = Heilongjiang area) UT +08:30"										
"# Now part of Asia/Shanghai; its pre-1970 times are not recorded here."

# From Luther Ma (2009-10-17):										
# Almost all (>99.9%) ethnic Chinese (properly ethnic Han) living in										
# Xinjiang use Chinese Standard Time. Some are aware of Xinjiang time,										
# but have no need of it. All planes, trains, and schools function on										
"# what is called ""Beijing time."" When Han make an appointment in Chinese"										
# they implicitly use Beijing time.										
#										
# On the other hand, ethnic Uyghurs, who make up about half the										
"# population of Xinjiang, typically use ""Xinjiang time"" which is two"										
# hours behind Beijing time, or UT +06. The government of the Xinjiang										
# Uyghur Autonomous Region, (XAUR, or just Xinjiang for short) as well as										
# local governments such as the Ürümqi city government use both times in										
# publications, referring to what is popularly called Xinjiang time as										
"# ""Ürümqi time."" When Uyghurs make an appointment in the Uyghur language"										
# they almost invariably use Xinjiang time.										
#										
# (Their ethnic Han compatriots would typically have no clue of its										
# widespread use, however, because so extremely few of them are fluent in										
# Uyghur, comparable to the number of Anglo-Americans fluent in Navajo.)										
#										
# (...As with the rest of China there was a brief interval ending in 1990										
# or 1991 when summer time was in use.  The confusion was severe, with										
# the province not having dual times but four times in use at the same										
# time. Some areas remained on standard Xinjiang time or Beijing time and										
# others moving their clocks ahead.)										
										
# From Luther Ma (2009-11-19):										
# With the risk of being redundant to previous answers these are the most common										
"# English ""transliterations"" (w/o using non-English symbols):"										
#										
# 1. Wulumuqi...										
# 2. Kashi...										
# 3. Urumqi...										
# 4. Kashgar...										
# ...										
# 5. It seems that Uyghurs in Ürümqi has been using Xinjiang since at least the										
# 1960's. I know of one Han, now over 50, who grew up in the surrounding										
# countryside and used Xinjiang time as a child.										
#										
# 6. Likewise for Kashgar and the rest of south Xinjiang I don't know of any										
# start date for Xinjiang time.										
#										
# Without having access to local historical records, nor the ability to legally										
# publish them, I would go with October 1, 1949, when Xinjiang became the Uyghur										
# Autonomous Region under the PRC. (Before that Uyghurs, of course, would also										
# not be using Beijing time, but some local time.)										
										
# From David Cochrane (2014-03-26):										
# Just a confirmation that Ürümqi time was implemented in Ürümqi on 1 Feb 1986:										
# https://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960684,00.html										
										
# From Luther Ma (2014-04-22):										
# I have interviewed numerous people of various nationalities and from										
# different localities in Xinjiang and can confirm the information in Guo's										
# report regarding Xinjiang, as well as the Time article reference by David										
# Cochrane.  Whether officially recognized or not (and both are officially										
# recognized), two separate times have been in use in Xinjiang since at least										
"# the Cultural Revolution: Xinjiang Time (XJT), aka Ürümqi Time or local time;"										
# and Beijing Time.  There is no confusion in Xinjiang as to which name refers										
# to which time. Both are widely used in the province, although in some										
# population groups might be use one to the exclusion of the other.  The only										
# problem is that computers and smart phones list Ürümqi (or Kashgar) as										
# having the same time as Beijing.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):										
# In the early days of the PRC, Tibet was given its own time zone (UT +06)										
"# but this was withdrawn in 1959 and never reinstated; see Tubten Khétsun,"										
# Memories of life in Lhasa under Chinese Rule, Columbia U Press, ISBN										
# 978-0231142861 (2008), translator's introduction by Matthew Akester, p x.										
# As this is before our 1970 cutoff, Tibet doesn't need a separate zone.										
#										
# Xinjiang Time is well-documented as being officially recognized.  E.g., see										
"# ""The Working-Calendar for The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Government"""										
# <http://www.sinkiang.gov.cn/service/ourworking/> (2014-04-22).										
# Unfortunately, we have no good records of time in Xinjiang before 1986.										
# During the 20th century parts of Xinjiang were ruled by the Qing dynasty,										
# the Republic of China, various warlords, the First and Second East Turkestan										
# Republics, the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang, and the People's Republic of										
# China, and tracking down all these organizations' timekeeping rules would be										
# quite a trick.  Approximate this lost history by a transition from LMT to										
# UT +06 at the start of 1928, the year of accession of the warlord Jin Shuren,										
# which happens to be the date given by Shanks & Pottenger (no doubt as a										
# guess) as the transition from LMT.  Ignore the usage of +08 before										
# 1986-02-01 under the theory that the transition date to +08 is unknown and										
# that the sort of users who prefer Asia/Urumqi now typically ignored the										
# +08 mandate back then.

# Taiwan										
										
# From smallufo (2010-04-03):										
# According to Taiwan's CWB [Central Weather Bureau],										
# http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V6/astronomy/cdata/summert.htm										
# Taipei has DST in 1979 between July 1st and Sep 30.										
										
# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2013-07-12):										
# On Dec 28, 1895, the Meiji Emperor announced Ordinance No. 167 of										
"# Meiji Year 28 ""The clause about standard time"", mentioned that"										
# Taiwan and Penghu Islands, as well as Yaeyama and Miyako Islands										
# (both in Okinawa) adopt the Western Standard Time which is based on										
# 120E. The adoption began from Jan 1, 1896. The original text can be										
# found on Wikisource:										
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/標準時ニ關スル件_(公布時)										
# ... This could be the first adoption of time zone in Taiwan, because										
# during the Qing Dynasty, it seems that there was no time zone										
# declared officially.										
#										
# Later, in the beginning of World War II, on Sep 25, 1937, the Showa										
"# Emperor announced Ordinance No. 529 of Showa Year 12 ""The clause of"										
# revision in the ordinance No. 167 of Meiji year 28 about standard										
"# time"", in which abolished the adoption of Western Standard Time in"										
# western islands (listed above), which means the whole Japan										
# territory, including later occupations, adopt Japan Central Time										
# (UTC+9). The adoption began on Oct 1, 1937. The original text can										
# be found on Wikisource:										
# https://ja.wikisource.org/wiki/明治二十八年勅令第百六十七號標準時ニ關スル件中改正ノ件										
#										
# That is, the time zone of Taipei switched to UTC+9 on Oct 1, 1937.										
										
# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):										
# I've found more evidence about when the time zone was switched from UTC+9										
# back to UTC+8 after WW2.  I believe it was on Sep 21, 1945.  In a document										
# during Japanese era [1] in which the officer told the staff to change time										
# zone back to Western Standard Time (UTC+8) on Sep 21.  And in another										
# history page of National Cheng Kung University [2], on Sep 21 there is a										
"# note ""from today, switch back to Western Standard Time"".  From these two"										
# materials, I believe that the time zone change happened on Sep 21.  And										
"# today I have found another monthly journal called ""The Astronomical Herald"""										
# from The Astronomical Society of Japan [3] in which it mentioned the fact										
# that:										
#										
# 1. Standard Time of the Country (Japan) was adopted on Jan 1, 1888, using										
# the time at 135E (GMT+9)										
#										
# 2. Standard Time of the Country was renamed to Central Standard Time, on Jan										
# 1, 1898, and on the same day, the new territories Taiwan and Penghu islands,										
# as well as Yaeyama and Miyako islands, adopted a new time zone called										
# Western Standard Time, which is in GMT+8.										
#										
# 3. Western Standard Time was deprecated on Sep 30, 1937. From then all the										
# territories of Japan adopted the same time zone, which is Central Standard										
# Time.

# Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-03):										
# I finally have found the real official gazette about changing back to										
# Western Standard Time on Sep 21 in Taiwan.  It's Taiwan Governor-General										
# Bulletin No. 386 in Showa 20 years (1945), published on Sep 19, 1945. [1] ...										
# [It] abolishes Bulletin No. 207 in Showa 12 years (1937), which is a local										
# bulletin in Taiwan for that Ordinance No. 529. It also mentioned that 1am on										
# Sep 21, 1945 will be 12am on Sep 21.  I think this bulletin is much more										
# official than the one I mentioned in my first mail, because it's from the										
# top-level government in Taiwan. If you're going to quote any resource, this										
# would be a good one.

# From Yu-Cheng Chuang (2014-07-02):										
# In 1946, DST in Taiwan was from May 15 and ended on Sep 30. The info from										
# Central Weather Bureau website was not correct.										
#										
# Original Bulletin:										
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=03502F0AKM1AF										
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=0350300AKM1B0 (cont.)										
#										
# In 1947, DST in Taiwan was expanded to Oct 31. There is a backup of that										
# telegram announcement from Taiwan Province Government:										
#										
# http://subtpg.tpg.gov.tw/og/image2.asp?f=0360310AKZ431										
#										
# Here is a brief translation:										
#										
#   The Summer Time this year is adopted from midnight Apr 15 until Sep 20										
#   midnight. To save (energy?) consumption, we're expanding Summer Time										
#   adoption till Oct 31 midnight.										
#										
# The Central Weather Bureau website didn't mention that, however it can										
# be found from historical government announcement database.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-03):										
# As per Yu-Cheng Chuang, say that Taiwan was at UT +09 from 1937-10-01										
# until 1945-09-21 at 01:00, overriding Shanks & Pottenger.										
# Likewise, use Yu-Cheng Chuang's data for DST in Taiwan.

# We have no details, but we'll guess they didn't move the clocks back in fall.										
#

# Instead of putting back clocks at the end of October, Georgia										
# will stay on daylight savings time this winter to save energy,										
# President Eduard Shevardnadze decreed Wednesday.										
#										
# From the BBC via Joseph S. Myers (2004-06-27):										
#										
# Georgia moved closer to Western Europe on Sunday...  The former Soviet										
# republic has changed its time zone back to that of Moscow.  As a result it										
# is now just four hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time, rather than five hours										
# ahead.  The switch was decreed by the pro-Western president of Georgia,										
# Mikheil Saakashvili, who said the change was partly prompted by the process										
# of integration into Europe.										
										
# From Teimuraz Abashidze (2005-11-07):										
# Government of Georgia ... decided to NOT CHANGE daylight savings time on										
# [Oct.] 30, as it was done before during last more than 10 years.										
# Currently, we are in fact GMT +4:00, as before 30 October it was GMT										
# +3:00.... The problem is, there is NO FORMAL LAW or governmental document										
# about it.  As far as I can find, I was told, that there is no document,

# From Paul Eggert (2014-09-06):

# From Gwillim Law (2001-05-28), overriding Shanks & Pottenger:										
# http://www.sumatera-inc.com/go_to_invest/about_indonesia.asp#standtime										
# says that Indonesia's time zones changed on 1988-01-01.  Looking at some										
# time zone maps, I think that must refer to Western Borneo (Kalimantan Barat										
# and Kalimantan Tengah) switching from UTC+8 to UTC+7.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2007-03-10):										
# Here is another correction to Shanks & Pottenger.										
# JohnTWB writes that Japanese forces did not surrender control in										
# Indonesia until 1945-09-01 00:00 at the earliest (in Jakarta) and										
# other formal surrender ceremonies were September 9, 11, and 13, plus										
# September 12 for the regional surrender to Mountbatten in Singapore.										
# These would be the earliest possible times for a change.										
# Régimes horaires pour le monde entier, by Henri Le Corre, (Éditions										
# Traditionnelles, 1987, Paris) says that Java and Madura switched										
# from UT +09 to +07:30 on 1945-09-23, and gives 1944-09-01 for Jayapura										
# (Hollandia).  For now, assume all Indonesian locations other than Jayapura										
# switched on 1945-09-23.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2013-08-11):										
# Normally the tz database uses English-language abbreviations, but in										
# Indonesia it's typical to use Indonesian-language abbreviations even										
# when writing in English.  For example, see the English-language										
# summary published by the Time and Frequency Laboratory of the										
# Research Center for Calibration, Instrumentation and Metrology,										
# Indonesia, <http://time.kim.lipi.go.id/time-eng.php> (2006-09-29).										
# The time zone abbreviations and UT offsets are:										
#										
# WIB  - +07 - Waktu Indonesia Barat (Indonesia western time)										
# WITA - +08 - Waktu Indonesia Tengah (Indonesia central time)

# From Roozbeh Pournader (2003-03-15):										
# This is an English translation of what I just found (originally in Persian).										
# The Gregorian dates in brackets are mine:										
#										
#	Official Newspaper No. 13548-1370/6/25 [1991-09-16]									
#	No. 16760/T233 H				1370/6/10 [1991-09-01]					
#										
#	The Rule About Change of the Official Time of the Country									
#										
#	The Board of Ministers, in the meeting dated 1370/5/23 [1991-08-14],									
#	based on the suggestion number 2221/D dated 1370/4/22 [1991-07-13]									
#	of the Country's Organization for Official and Employment Affairs,									
#	and referring to the law for equating the working hours of workers									
#	and officers in the whole country dated 1359/4/23 [1980-07-14], and									
#	for synchronizing the official times of the country, agreed that:									
#										
#	The official time of the country will should move forward one hour									
#	at the 24[:00] hours of the first day of Farvardin and should return									
#	to its previous state at the 24[:00] hours of the 30th day of									
#	Shahrivar.									
#										
#	First Deputy to the President - Hassan Habibi									
#										
# From personal experience, that agrees with what has been followed										
# for at least the last 5 years.  Before that, for a few years, the										
# date used was the first Thursday night of Farvardin and the last										
# Thursday night of Shahrivar, but I can't give exact dates....										
#										
# From Roozbeh Pournader (2005-04-05):										
# The text of the Iranian law, in effect since 1925, clearly mentions										
# that the true solar year is the measure, and there is no arithmetic										
# leap year calculation involved.  There has never been any serious										
# plan to change that law....										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):										
# Go with Shanks & Pottenger before Sept. 1991, and with Pournader thereafter.										
# I used Ed Reingold's cal-persia in GNU Emacs 21.2 to check Persian dates,										
# stopping after 2037 when 32-bit time_t's overflow.										
# That cal-persia used Birashk's approximation, which disagrees with the solar										
# calendar predictions for the year 2025, so I corrected those dates by hand.										
#										
# From Oscar van Vlijmen (2005-03-30), writing about future										
# discrepancies between cal-persia and the Iranian calendar:										
# For 2091 solar-longitude-after yields 2091-03-20 08:40:07.7 UT for										
# the vernal equinox and that gets so close to 12:00 some local										
# Iranian time that the definition of the correct location needs to be										
# known exactly, amongst other factors.  2157 is even closer:										
# 2157-03-20 08:37:15.5 UT.  But the Gregorian year 2025 should give										
# no interpretation problem whatsoever.  By the way, another instant										
# in the near future where there will be a discrepancy between										
# arithmetical and astronomical Iranian calendars will be in 2058:										
# vernal equinox on 2058-03-20 09:03:05.9 UT.  The Java version of										
# Reingold's/Dershowitz' calculator gives correctly the Gregorian date										
# 2058-03-21 for 1 Farvardin 1437 (astronomical).										
#										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-03-22):										
# Several of my users have reported that Iran will not observe DST anymore:										
# http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-17/0603193812164948.htm										
#										
# From Reuters (2007-09-16), with a heads-up from Jesper Nørgaard Welen:										
# ... the Guardian Council ... approved a law on Sunday to re-introduce										
# daylight saving time ...										
# https://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKBLA65048420070916										
#										
# From Roozbeh Pournader (2007-11-05):										
# This is quoted from Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of										
# Iran, Volume 63, No. 18242, dated Tuesday 1386/6/24										
# [2007-10-16]. I am doing the best translation I can:...										
# The official time of the country will be moved forward for one hour										
# on the 24 hours of the first day of the month of Farvardin and will										
# be changed back to its previous state on the 24 hours of the										
# thirtieth day of Shahrivar.

# From Jonathan Lennox (2000-06-12):										
"# An article in this week's Economist (""Inside the Saddam-free zone"", p. 50 in"										
# the U.S. edition) on the Iraqi Kurds contains a paragraph:										
"# ""The three northern provinces ... switched their clocks this spring and"										
"# are an hour ahead of Baghdad."""										
#										
# But Rives McDow (2000-06-18) quotes a contact in Iraqi-Kurdistan as follows:										
# In the past, some Kurdish nationalists, as a protest to the Iraqi										
# Government, did not adhere to daylight saving time.  They referred										
# to daylight saving as Saddam time.  But, as of today, the time zone										
# in Iraqi-Kurdistan is on standard time with Baghdad, Iraq.										
#										
# So we'll ignore the Economist's claim.

# From Ephraim Silverberg (2001-01-11):										
#										
"# I coined ""IST/IDT"" circa 1988.  Until then there were three"										
# different abbreviations in use:

# JST  Jerusalem Standard Time [Danny Braniss, Hebrew University]										
# IZT  Israel Zonal (sic) Time [Prof. Haim Papo, Technion]										
# EEST Eastern Europe Standard Time [used by almost everyone else]										
#										
# Since timezones should be called by country and not capital cities,										
# I ruled out JST.  As Israel is in Asia Minor and not Eastern Europe,										
"# EEST was equally unacceptable.  Since ""zonal"" was not compatible with"										
# any other timezone abbreviation, I felt that 'IST' was the way to go										
# and, indeed, it has received almost universal acceptance in timezone

# Occupation authorities imposed daylight-saving time on Japan on										
# [1948-05-01]....  But lack of prior debate and the execution of										
# daylight-saving time just three days after the bill was passed generated										
# deep hatred of the concept....  The Diet unceremoniously passed a bill to										
# dump the unpopular system in October 1951, less than a month after the San										
# Francisco Peace Treaty was signed.  (A government poll in 1951 showed 53%

# From Kazakhstan Embassy's News Bulletin No. 11										
# <http://www.kazsociety.org.uk/news/2005/03/30.htm> (2005-03-21):										
# The Government of Kazakhstan passed a resolution March 15 abolishing										
# daylight saving time citing lack of economic benefits and health										
# complications coupled with a decrease in productivity.										
#										
# From Branislav Kojic (in Astana) via Gwillim Law (2005-06-28):										
# ... what happened was that the former Kazakhstan Eastern time zone										
"# was ""blended"" with the Central zone.  Therefore, Kazakhstan now has"										
# two time zones, and difference between them is one hour.  The zone										
# closer to UTC is the former Western zone (probably still called the										
# same), encompassing four provinces in the west: Aqtöbe, Atyraū,										
# Mangghystaū, and West Kazakhstan.  The other zone encompasses										
# everything else....  I guess that would make Kazakhstan time zones										
# de jure UTC+5 and UTC+6 respectively.

# (text includes modification from the 1996 act)

"# according to time belts plus extra hour (""decree time""), moved clocks"

# 2:00, specified DST rules.  It acknowledged that Kazakhstan was

#										
# [For Qostanay] http://www.ng.kz/gazeta/195/hranit/

# Shanks & Pottenger say that Mongolia has three time zones, but										
# The USNO (1995-12-21) and the CIA map Standard Time Zones of the World										
# (2005-03) both say that it has just one.										
										
# From Oscar van Vlijmen (1999-12-11):										
# General Information Mongolia										
# <http://www.mongoliatourism.gov.mn/general.htm> (1999-09)										
"# ""Time: Mongolia has two time zones. Three westernmost provinces of"										
# Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, and Hovd are one hour earlier than the capital city, and										
# the rest of the country follows the Ulaanbaatar time, which is UTC/GMT plus										
"# eight hours."""										
										
# From Rives McDow (1999-12-13):										
"# Mongolia discontinued the use of daylight savings time in 1999; 1998"										
# being the last year it was implemented.  The dates of implementation I am										
# unsure of, but most probably it was similar to Russia, except for the time										
# of implementation may have been different....										
# Some maps in the past have indicated that there was an additional time										
# zone in the eastern part of Mongolia, including the provinces of Dornod,										
# Sükhbaatar, and possibly Khentii.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (1999-12-15):										
# Naming and spelling is tricky in Mongolia.										
"# We'll use Hovd (also spelled Chovd and Khovd) to represent the west zone;"										
# the capital of the Hovd province is sometimes called Hovd, sometimes Dund-Us,										
# and sometimes Jirgalanta (with variant spellings), but the name Hovd										
# is good enough for our purposes.										
										
# From Rives McDow (2001-05-13):										
# In addition to Mongolia starting daylight savings as reported earlier										
# (adopted DST on 2001-04-27 02:00 local time, ending 2001-09-28),										
# there are three time zones.										
#										
# Provinces [at 7:00]: Bayan-Ölgii, Uvs, Khovd, Zavkhan, Govi-Altai

# From Ganbold Ts., Ulaanbaatar (2004-04-17):										
# Daylight saving occurs at 02:00 local time last Saturday of March.										
# It will change back to normal at 02:00 local time last Saturday of										
# September.... As I remember this rule was changed in 2001.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2004-04-17):										
# For now, assume Rives McDow's informant got confused about Friday vs										
# Saturday, and that his 2001 dates should have 1 added to them.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2005-07-26):										
# We have wildly conflicting information about Mongolia's time zones.										
# Bill Bonnet (2005-05-19) reports that the US Embassy in Ulaanbaatar says

# For now, let's ignore this information, until we have more confirmation.

# From Deborah Goldsmith (2008-03-30):										
# We received a bug report claiming that the tz database UTC offset for										
# Asia/Choibalsan (GMT+09:00) is incorrect, and that it should be GMT										
# +08:00 instead. Different sources appear to disagree with the tz										
# database on this, e.g.:

# schedule here:										
# http://www.eznis.com/Container.jsp?id=112										
# (click the English flag for English)										
#										
# There it appears that flights between Choibalsan and Ulaanbaatar arrive										
# about 1:35 - 1:50 hours later in local clock time, no matter the										
# direction, while Ulaanbaatar-Khovd takes 2 hours in the Eastern										
# direction and 3:35 back, which indicates that Ulaanbaatar and Khovd are										
# in different time zones (like we know about), while Choibalsan and										
# Ulaanbaatar are in the same time zone (correction needed).										
										
# From Arthur David Olson (2008-05-19):

# XXX--in the absence of better information, assume that transition										
"# was at the start of 2008-03-31 (the day of Steffen Thorsen's report);"

# Palestine										
										
# From Amos Shapir (1998-02-15):										
#										
# From 1917 until 1948-05-15, all of Palestine, including the parts now										
# known as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, was under British rule.										
# Therefore the rules given for Israel for that period, apply there too...										
#										
# The Gaza Strip was under Egyptian rule between 1948-05-15 until 1967-06-05										
# (except a short occupation by Israel from 1956-11 till 1957-03, but no										
# time zone was affected then).  It was never formally annexed to Egypt,										
# though.										
#										
# The rest of Palestine was under Jordanian rule at that time, formally										
"# annexed in 1950 as the West Bank (and the word ""Trans"" was dropped from"										
"# the country's previous name of ""the Hashemite Kingdom of the"										
"# Trans-Jordan"").  So the rules for Jordan for that time apply.  Major"										
# towns in that area are Nablus (Shchem), El-Halil (Hebron), Ramallah, and										
# East Jerusalem.										
#										
# Both areas were occupied by Israel in June 1967, but not annexed (except										
"# for East Jerusalem).  They were on Israel time since then; there might"										
# have been a Military Governor's order about time zones, but I'm not aware										
# of any (such orders may have been issued semi-annually whenever summer										
# time was in effect, but maybe the legal aspect of time was just neglected).										
#										
# The Palestinian Authority was established in 1993, and got hold of most										
# towns in the West Bank and Gaza by 1995.  I know that in order to										
# demonstrate...independence, they have been switching to										
# summer time and back on a different schedule than Israel's, but I don't										
# know when this was started, or what algorithm is used (most likely the										
# Jordanian one).										
#										
# To summarize, the table should probably look something like that:										
#										
# Area \ when | 1918-1947 | 1948-1967 | 1967-1995 | 1996-										
# ------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------

# Gaza        | Zion      | Egypt     | Zion      | Jordan

# I guess more info may be available from the PA's web page (if/when they

# with Shapir and assume that it observed DST from 1940 through 1947,										
# and that it used Jordanian rules starting in 1996.										
# We don't yet need a separate entry for the West Bank, since										
# the only differences between it and Gaza that we know about										
# occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.										
# However, as we get more information, we may need to add entries										
# for parts of the West Bank as they transitioned from Israel's rules										
# to Palestine's rules.										
										
# From IINS News Service - Israel - 1998-03-23 10:38:07 Israel time,										
# forwarded by Ephraim Silverberg:										
#										
# Despite the fact that Israel changed over to daylight savings time										
# last week, the PLO Authority (PA) has decided not to turn its clocks										
# one-hour forward at this time.  As a sign of independence from Israeli rule,										
# the PA has decided to implement DST in April.

# http://www.jpost.com/com/Archive/22.Apr.1999/Opinion/Article-2.html										
# (Jerusalem Post, 1999-04-22) that										
# the Palestinian National Authority changed to DST on 1999-04-15.										
# I vaguely recall that they switch back in October (sorry, forgot the source).										
# For now, let's assume that the spring switch was at 24:00,										
# and that they switch at 0:00 on the 3rd Fridays of April and October.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2005-11-22):										
# Starting 2004 transitions are from Steffen Thorsen's web site timeanddate.com.										
										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2005-11-23):										
# A user from Gaza reported that Gaza made the change early because of										
# the Ramadan.  Next year Ramadan will be even earlier, so I think										
# there is a good chance next year's end date will be around two weeks										
# earlier - the same goes for Jordan.										
										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-08-17):										
# I was informed by a user in Bethlehem that in Bethlehem it started the										
# same day as Israel, and after checking with other users in the area, I										
# was informed that they started DST one day after Israel.  I was not										
# able to find any authoritative sources at the time, nor details if										
# Gaza changed as well, but presumed Gaza to follow the same rules as										
# the West Bank.

#										
# The 1906 transition was effective July 1 and standardized Indochina to										
"# Phù Liễn Observatory, legally 104 deg. 17'17"" east of Paris."										
# It's unclear whether this meant legal Paris Mean Time (00:09:21) or										
"# the Paris Meridian (2 deg. 20'14.03"" E); the former yields 07:06:30.1333..."										
# and the latter 07:06:29.333... so either way it rounds to 07:06:30,										
# which is used below even though the modern-day Phù Liễn Observatory										
# is closer to 07:06:31.  Abbreviate Phù Liễn Mean Time as PLMT.										
#										
# The following transitions occurred in Indochina in general (before 1954)

# Queensland

# From Alex Livingston (1996-11-01):										
# I have heard or read more than once that some resort islands off the coast										
# of Queensland chose to keep observing daylight-saving time even after										
# Queensland ceased to.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):										
# IATA SSIM (1993-02/1994-09) say that the Holiday Islands (Hayman, Lindeman,										
# Hamilton) observed DST for two years after the rest of Queensland stopped.										
# Hamilton is the largest, but there is also a Hamilton in Victoria,										
# so use Lindeman.										
#										
# From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):										
"# There is no location named Holiday Islands in Queensland Australia; holiday"										
# islands is a colloquial term used globally.  Hayman and Lindeman are at the										
# north and south extremes of the Whitsunday Islands archipelago, and										
"# Hamilton is in between; it is reasonable to believe that this time zone"										
# applies to all of the Whitsundays.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):										
# Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting										
# region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.										
# For example, in her review of Graeme Davison's _The Unforgiving										
# Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native										
"# Phillipa J Martyr wrote, ""The section entitled 'Saving Daylight' was"

# Lawlink NSW:Daylight Saving in New South Wales										
# http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_agdinfo.nsf/pages/community_relations_daylight_saving										
# covers New South Wales in particular.										
										
# From John Mackin (1991-03-06):										
# We in Australia have _never_ referred to DST as 'daylight' time.										
# It is called 'summer' time.  Now by a happy coincidence, 'summer'										
"# and 'standard' happen to start with the same letter; hence, the"										
# abbreviation does _not_ change...										
# The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least										
# in this State, but the abbreviation is just commonly taken to be the										
# initials of the phrase, and the legislation here uniformly uses										
# the phrase 'summer time' and does not use the phrase 'daylight										
# time'.										
# Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian										
# Broadcasting Commission), use the phrases 'Eastern Standard Time'										
# or 'Eastern Summer Time'.  (Note, though, that as I say in the										
# current australasia file, there is really no such thing.)  Announcers										
# on its overseas service, Radio Australia, use the same phrases										
"# prefixed by the word 'Australian' when referring to local times;"										
# time announcements on that service, naturally enough, are made in UTC.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):										
#										
# Inspired by Mackin's remarks quoted above, earlier versions of this										
"# file used ""EST"" for both Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Summer"										
"# Time in Australia, and similarly for ""CST"", ""CWST"", and ""WST""."										
# However, these abbreviations were confusing and were not common										
# practice among Australians, and there were justifiable complaints										
# about them, so I attempted to survey current Australian usage.										
"# For the tz database, the full English phrase is not that important;"										
# what matters is the abbreviation.  It's difficult to survey the web										
# directly for abbreviation usage, as there are so many false hits for										
"# strings like ""EST"" and ""EDT"", so I looked for pages that defined an"										
# abbreviation for eastern or central DST in Australia, and got the										
# following numbers of unique hits for the listed Google queries:										
#										
"#   10 ""Eastern Daylight Time AEST"" site:au [some are false hits]"										
"#   10 ""Eastern Summer Time AEST"" site:au"										
"#   10 ""Summer Time AEDT"" site:au"										
"#   13 ""EDST Eastern Daylight Saving Time"" site:au"										
"#   18 ""Summer Time ESST"" site:au"										
"#   28 ""Eastern Daylight Saving Time EDST"" site:au"										
"#   39 ""EDT Eastern Daylight Time"" site:au [some are false hits]"										
"#   53 ""Eastern Daylight Time EDT"" site:au [some are false hits]"										
"#   54 ""AEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time"" site:au"										
"#  182 ""Eastern Daylight Time AEDT"" site:au"										
#										
"#   17 ""Central Daylight Time CDT"" site:au [some are false hits]"										
"#   46 ""Central Daylight Time ACDT"" site:au"										
#										
"# I tried several other variants (e.g., ""Eastern Summer Time EST"") but"										
# they all returned fewer than 10 unique hits.  I also looked for pages										
"# mentioning both ""western standard time"" and an abbreviation, since"										
# there is no WST in the US to generate false hits, and found:										
#										
"#  156 ""western standard time"" AWST site:au"										
"#  226 ""western standard time"" WST site:au"										
#										
# I then surveyed the top ten newspapers in Australia by circulation as										
"# listed in Wikipedia, using Google queries like ""AEDT site:heraldsun.com.au"""										
# and obtaining estimated counts from the initial page of search results.										
"# All ten papers greatly preferred ""AEDT"" to ""EDT"".  The papers"										
# surveyed were the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Courier-Mail,										
# The Sydney Morning Herald, The West Australian, The Age, The Advertiser,										
# The Australian, The Financial Review, and The Herald (Newcastle).										
#										
# I also searched for historical usage, to see whether abbreviations										
"# like ""AEDT"" are new.  A Trove search <http://trove.nla.gov.au/>"										
# found only one newspaper (The Canberra Times) with a house style										
# dating back to the 1970s, I expect because other newspapers weren't										
# fully indexed.  The Canberra Times strongly preferred abbreviations										
"# like ""AEDT"".  The first occurrence of ""AEDT"" was a World Weather"										
"# column (1971-11-17, page 24), and of ""ACDT"" was a Scoreboard column"										
# (1993-01-24, p 16).  The style was the typical usage but was not										
"# strictly enforced; for example, ""Welcome to the twilight zones ..."""										
# (1994-10-29, p 1) uses the abbreviations AEST/AEDT, CST/CDT, and										
"# WST, and goes on to say, ""The confusion and frustration some feel"										
# about the lack of uniformity among Australia's six states and two										
# territories has prompted one group to form its very own political										
"# party -- the Sydney-based Daylight Saving Extension Party."""

"#   EST CST WST preferred for standard time; AEST AEDT ACST ACDT also used"										
#										
#   The Transport Safety Bureau has an extensive series of accident reports,										
#   and investigators seem to use whatever abbreviation they like.										
#   Googling site:atsb.gov.au found the following number of unique hits:										
"#   311 ""ESuT"", 195 ""EDT"", 26 ""AEDT"", 83 ""CSuT"", 46 ""CDT""."										
"#   ""_SuT"" tended to appear in older reports, and ""A_DT"" tended to"										
#   appear in reports of events with international implications.										
#										
# From the above it appears that there is a working consensus in										
"# Australia to use trailing ""DT"" for daylight saving time; although"										
"# some sources use trailing ""SST"" or ""ST"" or ""SuT"" they are by far in"										
"# the minority.  The case for leading ""A"" is weaker, but since it"										
# seems to be preferred in the overall web and is preferred in all										
# the leading newspaper websites and in many government departments,										
"# it has a stronger case than omitting the leading ""A"".  The current"										
"# version of the database therefore uses abbreviations like ""AEST"" and"										
"# ""AEDT"" for Australian time zones."

# residents decided to forget about this nonsense of changing the clock so

# Australia and Western Australia....

"# dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered ""the time"" from the border"

# as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is										
# the largest population centre in this zone....										
#										
# Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the

# just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,

#										
# (2006-12-09):										
# I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving

"# Observatories""[1], and in particular the Shrine of Remembrance[2] located"										
# in Melbourne, Australia.										
#										
# Apparently the shrine's main purpose is a beam of sunlight which

# of the 11th month (Remembrance Day) every year in memory of Australia's

#										
# However, that is only because of some special mirror contraption that had										
# to be employed, since due to daylight savings time, the true solar time of										
# the remembrance moment occurs one hour later (or earlier?).  Perhaps

#										
# Saturday, the 14th [of October, 1950] - ...  The time was all the										
# more confusing at that point, because we had crossed the										
# International Date Line, thus getting two Sundays.  Furthermore, we

# The International Date Line										
										
# From Gwillim Law (2000-01-03):										
#										
# The International Date Line is not defined by any international standard,										
# convention, or treaty.  Mapmakers are free to draw it as they please.										
# Reputable mapmakers will simply ensure that every point of land appears on										
# the correct side of the IDL, according to the date legally observed there.										
#										
# When Kiribati adopted a uniform date in 1995, thereby moving the Phoenix and										
# Line Islands to the west side of the IDL (or, if you prefer, moving the IDL										
# to the east side of the Phoenix and Line Islands), I suppose that most										
# mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line										
# has a rather arbitrary nature.  The straight-line boundaries between Pacific										
# island nations that are shown on many maps are based on an international										
# convention, but are not legally binding national borders.... The date is										
"# governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some"										
# places as late as fourteen hours later than UTC.  And, since the IDL is not										
# an international standard, there are some places on the high seas where the										
# correct date is ambiguous.										
										
# From Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone> (2005-08-31):										
# Before 1920, all ships kept local apparent time on the high seas by setting										
# their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship's										
# speed and direction, it would be 12 o'clock when the Sun crossed the ship's										
# meridian (12 o'clock = local apparent noon).  During 1917, at the										
# Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, it was recommended that all										
# ships, both military and civilian, should adopt hourly standard time zones										
# on the high seas.  Whenever a ship was within the territorial waters of any										
# nation it would use that nation's standard time.  The captain was permitted										
# to change his ship's clocks at a time of his choice following his ship's										
# entry into another zone time - he often chose midnight.  These zones were										
# adopted by all major fleets between 1920 and 1925 but not by many										
# independent merchant ships until World War II.										
										
# From Paul Eggert, using references suggested by Oscar van Vlijmen										
# (2005-03-20):										
#										
# The American Practical Navigator (2002)										
# http://pollux.nss.nima.mil/pubs/pubs_j_apn_sections.html?rid=187										
# talks only about the 180-degree meridian with respect to ships in										
"# international waters; it ignores the international date line."

# Britain (United Kingdom) and Ireland (Eire)										
										
# From Peter Ilieve (1994-07-06):										
#										
# On 17 Jan 1994 the Independent, a UK quality newspaper, had a piece about										
# historical vistas along the Thames in west London. There was a photo										
# and a sketch map showing some of the sightlines involved. One paragraph										
# of the text said:										
#										
# 'An old stone obelisk marking a forgotten terrestrial meridian stands										
# beside the river at Kew. In the 18th century, before time and longitude										
# was standardised by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, scholars observed										
# this stone and the movement of stars from Kew Observatory nearby. They										
# made their calculations and set the time for the Horse Guards and Parliament,										
# but now the stone is obscured by scrubwood and can only be seen by walking										
# along the towpath within a few yards of it.'										
#										
# I have a one inch to one mile map of London and my estimate of the stone's										
"# position is 51 degrees 28' 30"" N, 0 degrees 18' 45"" W. The longitude should"										
"# be within about +-2"". The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TQ172761."										
#										
# [This yields GMTOFF = -0:01:15 for London LMT in the 18th century.]										
										
# From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):										
#										
# Howse writes that Britain was the first country to use standard time.										
# The railways cared most about the inconsistencies of local mean time,										
# and it was they who forced a uniform time on the country.										
# The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828)										
# and was popularized by Abraham Follett Osler (1808-1903).										
# The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway										
"# in November 1840; other railways followed suit, and by 1847 most"										
# (though not all) railways used London time.  On 1847-09-22 the										
# Railway Clearing House, an industry standards body, recommended that GMT be										
# adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it.										
# The transition occurred on 12-01 for the L&NW, the Caledonian,										
"# and presumably other railways; the January 1848 Bradshaw's lists many"										
# railways as using GMT.  By 1855 the vast majority of public										
# clocks in Britain were set to GMT (though some, like the great clock										
# on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, were fitted with two minute hands,										
# one for local time and one for GMT).  The last major holdout was the legal										
# system, which stubbornly stuck to local time for many years, leading										
# to oddities like polls opening at 08:13 and closing at 16:13.										
# The legal system finally switched to GMT when the Statutes (Definition										
"# of Time) Act took effect; it received the Royal Assent on 1880-08-02."										
#										
# In the tables below, we condense this complicated story into a single										
# transition date for London, namely 1847-12-01.  We don't know as much										
# about Dublin, so we use 1880-08-02, the legal transition time.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-19):										
# The ancients had no need for daylight saving, as they kept time										
# informally or via hours whose length depended on the time of year.										
# Daylight saving time in its modern sense was invented by the										
# New Zealand entomologist George Vernon Hudson (1867-1946),										
# whose day job as a postal clerk led him to value										
# after-hours daylight in which to pursue his research.										
# In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society										
# that proposed a two-hour daylight-saving shift.  See:										
# Hudson GV. On seasonal time-adjustment in countries south of lat. 30 deg.										
"# Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute. 1895;28:734"										
# http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_28/rsnz_28_00_006110.html										
# Although some interest was expressed in New Zealand, his proposal										
# did not find its way into law and eventually it was almost forgotten.										
#										
# In England, DST was independently reinvented by William Willett (1857-1915),										
# a London builder and member of the Royal Astronomical Society										
"# who circulated a pamphlet ""The Waste of Daylight"" (1907)"										
# that proposed advancing clocks 20 minutes on each of four Sundays in April,										
# and retarding them by the same amount on four Sundays in September.										
# A bill was drafted in 1909 and introduced in Parliament several times,										
# but it met with ridicule and opposition, especially from farming interests.										
# Later editions of the pamphlet proposed one-hour summer time, and										
# it was eventually adopted as a wartime measure in 1916.										
# See: Summer Time Arrives Early, The Times (2000-05-18).										
# A monument to Willett was unveiled on 1927-05-21, in an open space in										
# a 45-acre wood near Chislehurst, Kent that was purchased by popular										
# subscription and open to the public.  On the south face of the monolith,										
# designed by G. W. Miller, is the William Willett Memorial Sundial,										
# which is permanently set to Summer Time.										
										
# From Winston Churchill (1934-04-28):										
# It is one of the paradoxes of history that we should owe the boon of										
# summer time, which gives every year to the people of this country										
# between 160 and 170 hours more daylight leisure, to a war which										
# plunged Europe into darkness for four years, and shook the										
# foundations of civilization throughout the world.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-08-08):										
"# The OED Supplement says that the English originally said ""Daylight Saving"""										
"# when they were debating the adoption of DST in 1908; but by 1916 this"										
# term appears only in quotes taken from DST's opponents, whereas the										
"# proponents (who eventually won the argument) are quoted as using ""Summer""."

# From Chris Carrier (1996-06-14):										
# I remember reading in various wartime issues of the London Times the										
# acronym BDST for British Double Summer Time.  Look for the published										
# time of sunrise and sunset in The Times, when BDST was in effect, and										
"# if you find a zone reference it will say, ""All times B.D.S.T."""										
										
# From Joseph S. Myers (1999-09-02):										
# ... some military cables (WO 219/4100 - this is a copy from the										
# main SHAEF archives held in the US National Archives, SHAEF/5252/8/516)										
# agree that the usage is BDST (this appears in a message dated 17 Feb 1945).										
										
# From Joseph S. Myers (2000-10-03):										
# On 18th April 1941, Sir Stephen Tallents of the BBC wrote to Sir										
# Alexander Maxwell of the Home Office asking whether there was any										
"# official designation; the reply of the 21st was that there wasn't"										
"# but he couldn't think of anything better than the ""Double British"

# https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/ho-19410421.png										
										
# From Sir Alexander Maxwell in the above-mentioned letter (1941-04-21):										
# [N]o official designation has as far as I know been adopted for the time										
# which is to be introduced in May....										
"# I cannot think of anything better than ""Double British Summer Time"""										
# which could not be said to run counter to any official description.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):										
# Howse writes (p 157) 'DBST' too, but 'BDST' seems to have been common										
# and follows the more usual convention of putting the location name first,										
# so we use 'BDST'.										
										
# Peter Ilieve (1998-04-19) described at length										
# the history of summer time legislation in the United Kingdom.										
# Since 1998 Joseph S. Myers has been updating										
# and extending this list, which can be found in										
# https://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/										
										
# From Joseph S. Myers (1998-01-06):										
#										
"# The legal time in the UK outside of summer time is definitely GMT, not UTC;"										
# see Lord Tanlaw's speech										
# https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo970611/text/70611-10.htm#70611-10_head0										
# (Lords Hansard 11 June 1997 columns 964 to 976).										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):										
#										
# For lack of other data, follow Shanks & Pottenger for Eire in 1940-1948.										
#										
# Given Ilieve and Myers's data, the following claims by Shanks & Pottenger										
# are incorrect:										
#     * Wales did not switch from GMT to daylight saving time until										
#	1921 Apr 3, when they began to conform with the rest of Great Britain.									
# Actually, Wales was identical after 1880.										
#     * Eire had two transitions on 1916 Oct 1.										
# It actually just had one transition.										
#     * Northern Ireland used single daylight saving time throughout WW II.										
# Actually, it conformed to Britain.										
#     * GB-Eire changed standard time to 1 hour ahead of GMT on 1968-02-18.										
# Actually, that date saw the usual switch to summer time.										
# Standard time was not changed until 1968-10-27 (the clocks didn't change).										
#										
# Here is another incorrect claim by Shanks & Pottenger:										
#     * Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man did not switch from GMT										
#	to daylight saving time until 1921 Apr 3, when they began to									
#	conform with Great Britain.									
# S.R.&O. 1916, No. 382 and HO 45/10811/312364 (quoted above) say otherwise.										
#										
"# The following claim by Shanks & Pottenger is possible though doubtful;"										
# we'll ignore it for now.										
#     * Dublin's 1971-10-31 switch was at 02:00, even though London's was 03:00.										
#										
#										
# Whitman says Dublin Mean Time was -0:25:21, which is more precise than										
# Shanks & Pottenger.										
# Perhaps this was Dunsink Observatory Time, as Dunsink Observatory										
# (8 km NW of Dublin's center) seemingly was to Dublin as Greenwich was										
# to London.  For example:										
#										
"#   ""Timeball on the ballast office is down.  Dunsink time."""										
#   -- James Joyce, Ulysses										
										
"# ""Countess Markievicz ... claimed that the [1916] abolition of Dublin Mean Time"										
# was among various actions undertaken by the 'English' government that										
# would 'put the whole country into the SF (Sinn Féin) camp'.  She claimed										
"# Irish 'public feeling (was) outraged by forcing of English time on us'."""

# should allow various updates to the comments in the europe file to cover										
# the laws applicable in Ireland.)										
#										
# (Note that the time in the Republic of Ireland since 1968 has been defined										
# in terms of standard time being GMT+1 with a period of winter time when it										
# is GMT, rather than standard time being GMT with a period of summer time										
# being GMT+1.)										
										
# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-28):										
# Clive Feather (<news:859845706.26043.0@office.demon.net>, 1997-03-31)										
# reports that Folkestone (Cheriton) Shuttle Terminal uses Concession Time										
# (CT), equivalent to French civil time.										
# Julian Hill (<news:36118128.5A14@virgin.net>, 1998-09-30) reports that										
# trains between Dollands Moor (the freight facility next door)										
# and Frethun run in CT.										
# My admittedly uninformed guess is that the terminal has two authorities,										
# the French concession operators and the British civil authorities,										
# and that the time depends on who you're talking to.										
# If, say, the British police were called to the station for some reason,										
# I would expect the official police report to use GMT/BST and not CET/CEST.										
# This is a borderline case, but for now let's stick to GMT/BST.										
										
# From an anonymous contributor (1996-06-02):										
# The law governing time in Ireland is under Statutory Instrument SI 395/94,										
# which gives force to European Union 7th Council Directive No. 94/21/EC.										
# Under this directive, the Minister for Justice in Ireland makes appropriate										
# regulations. I spoke this morning with the Secretary of the Department of										
# Justice (tel +353 1 678 9711) who confirmed to me that the correct name is										
"# ""Irish Summer Time"", abbreviated to ""IST""."

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-07):										
# Wikipedia and other sources refer to the Act of the Council of										
# Ministers of the USSR from 1988-01-04 No. 5 and the Act of the										
# Council of Ministers of the USSR from 1989-03-14 No. 227.										
#										
# I did not find full texts of these acts.  For the 1989 one we have										
# title at https://base.garant.ru/70754136/ :										
"# ""About change in calculation of time on the territories of"										
# Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR and Estonian SSR, Astrakhan,										
"# Kaliningrad, Kirov, Kuybyshev, Ulyanovsk and Uralsk oblasts""."										
# And http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt appears to										
# contain quotes from both acts: Since last Sunday of March 1988 rules										
# of the second time belt are installed in Volgograd and Saratov										
# oblasts.  Since last Sunday of March 1989:										
# a) Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR, Estonian SSR, Kaliningrad oblast:										
"# second time belt rules without extra hour (Moscow-1);"										
# b) Astrakhan, Kirov, Kuybyshev, Ulyanovsk oblasts: second time belt										
# rules (Moscow time)										
# c) Uralsk oblast: third time belt rules (Moscow+1).										
										
# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-27):										
# Unamended version of the act of the										
# Government of the Russian Federation No. 23 from 08.01.1992										
# http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102014034&rdk=0										
# says that every year clocks were to be moved forward on last Sunday										
# of March at 2 hours and moved backwards on last Sunday of September										
# at 3 hours.  It was amended in 1996 to replace September with October.										
										
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-06-14):										
# According to Kremlin press service, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev										
"# signed a federal law ""On calculation of time"" on June 9, 2011."										
# According to the law Russia is abolishing daylight saving time.										
#

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-04-26):										
# http://www.hum.aau.dk/~poe/tid/tine/DanskTid.htm says that the law										
# [introducing standard time] was in effect from 1894-01-01....										
# The page http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A18930008330-REGL										
# confirms this, and states that the law was put forth 1893-03-29.										
#										
# The EU treaty with effect from 1973:										
# http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19722110030-REGL										
#										
# This provoked a new law from 1974 to make possible summer time changes										
# in subsequent decrees with the law										
# http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19740022330-REGL										
#										
# It seems however that no decree was set forward until 1980.  I have										
# not found any decree, but in another related law, the effecting DST										
# changes are stated explicitly to be from 1980-04-06 at 02:00 to										
# 1980-09-28 at 02:00.  If this is true, this differs slightly from										
# the EU rule in that DST runs to 02:00, not 03:00.  We don't know										
# when Denmark began using the EU rule correctly, but we have only										
# confirmation of the 1980-time, so I presume it was correct in 1981:										
# The law is about the management of the extra hour, concerning										
# working hours reported and effect on obligatory-rest rules (which										
# was suspended on that night):										
# http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/C19801120554-REGL										
										
# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-06-11):										
# The Herning Folkeblad (1980-09-26) reported that the night between										
# Saturday and Sunday the clock is set back from three to two.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2005-06-11):										
"# Hence the ""02:00"" of the 1980 law refers to standard time, not"										
# wall-clock time, and so the EU rules were in effect in 1980.

# From Paul Eggert (2004-10-31):										
# During World War II, Germany maintained secret manned weather stations in										
# East Greenland and Franz Josef Land, but we don't know their time zones.										
# My source for this is Wilhelm Dege's book mentioned under Svalbard.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):										
# Greenland joined the EU as part of Denmark, obtained home rule on 1979-05-01,										
# and left the EU on 1985-02-01.  It therefore should have been using EU										
# rules at least through 1984.  Shanks & Pottenger say Scoresbysund and Godthåb										
# used C-Eur rules after 1980, but IATA SSIM (1991/1996) says they use EU										
# rules since at least 1991.  Assume EU rules since 1980.										
										
# From Gwillim Law (2001-06-06), citing										
# <http://www.statkart.no/efs/efshefter/2001/efs5-2001.pdf> (2001-03-15),										
# and with translations corrected by Steffen Thorsen:										
#										
# Greenland has four local times, and the relation to UTC										
# is according to the following time line:										
#										
# The military zone near Thule	UTC-4									
# Standard Greenland time	UTC-3									
# Scoresbysund			UTC-1							
# Danmarkshavn			UTC							
#										
# In the military area near Thule and in Danmarkshavn DST will not be										
# introduced.										
										
# From Rives McDow (2001-11-01):										
#										
# I correspond regularly with the Dansk Polarcenter, and wrote them at										
# the time to clarify the situation in Thule.  Unfortunately, I have										
# not heard back from them regarding my recent letter.  [But I have										
# info from earlier correspondence.]										
#										
# According to the center, a very small local time zone around Thule										
# Air Base keeps the time according to UTC-4, implementing daylight										
# savings using North America rules, changing the time at 02:00 local time....										
#										
# The east coast of Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund										
# uses UTC in the same way as in Iceland, year round, with no dst.										
# There are just a few stations on this coast, including the										
# Danmarkshavn ICAO weather station mentioned in your September 29th										
# email.  The other stations are two sledge patrol stations in										
# Mestersvig and Daneborg, the air force base at Station Nord, and the										
# DPC research station at Zackenberg.										
#										
# Scoresbysund and two small villages nearby keep time UTC-1 and use										
# the same daylight savings time period as in West Greenland (Godthåb).										
#										
# The rest of Greenland, including Godthåb (this area, although it										
# includes central Greenland, is known as west Greenland), keeps time										
# UTC-3, with daylight savings methods according to European rules.										
#										
# It is common procedure to use UTC 0 in the wilderness of East and										
# North Greenland, because it is mainly Icelandic aircraft operators										
# maintaining traffic in these areas.  However, the official status of										
# this area is that it sticks with Godthåb time.  This area might be										
# considered a dual time zone in some respects because of this.										
										
# From Rives McDow (2001-11-19):										
"# I heard back from someone stationed at Thule; the time change took place"										
# there at 2:00 AM.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):										
"# From 1997 on the CIA map shows Danmarkshavn on GMT;"										
# the 1995 map as like Godthåb.										
# For lack of better info, assume they were like Godthåb before 1996.										
# startkart.no says Thule does not observe DST, but this is clearly an error,										
# so go with Shanks & Pottenger for Thule transitions until this year.										
# For 2007 on assume Thule will stay in sync with US DST rules.										
										
# From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):										
"# ""Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund"" is officially named"										
"# ""National Park"" by Executive Order:"										
# http://naalakkersuisut.gl/~/media/Nanoq/Files/Attached%20Files/Engelske-tekster/Legislation/Executive%20Order%20National%20Park.rtf

# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):										
# The 1989 transition is from USSR act No. 227 (1989-03-14).										
#										
# From Peter Ilieve (1994-10-15):										
# A relative in Tallinn confirms the accuracy of the data for 1989 onwards										
# [through 1994] and gives the legal authority for it,										
# a regulation of the Government of Estonia, No. 111 of 1989....										
#										
# From Peter Ilieve (1996-10-28):										
# [IATA SSIM (1992/1996) claims that the Baltic republics switch at 01:00s,										
# but a relative confirms that Estonia still switches at 02:00s, writing:]										
"# ""I do not [know] exactly but there are some little different"										
# (confusing) rules for International Air and Railway Transport Schedules										
# conversion in Sunday connected with end of summer time in Estonia....										
# A discussion is running about the summer time efficiency and effect on										
# human physiology.  It seems that Estonia maybe will not change to										
"# summer time next spring."""										
										
# From Peter Ilieve (1998-11-04), heavily edited:										
# The 1998-09-22 Estonian time law										
# http://trip.rk.ee/cgi-bin/thw?${BASE}=akt&${OOHTML}=rtd&TA=1998&TO=1&AN=1390										
# refers to the Eighth Directive and cites the association agreement between										
# the EU and Estonia, ratified by the Estonian law (RT II 1995, 22-27, 120).										
#										
# I also asked [my relative] whether they use any standard abbreviation										
"# for their standard and summer times. He says no, they use ""suveaeg"""										
"# (summer time) and ""talveaeg"" (winter time)."										
										
# From The Baltic Times <https://www.baltictimes.com/> (1999-09-09)										
# via Steffen Thorsen:										
# This year will mark the last time Estonia shifts to summer time,										
# a council of the ruling coalition announced Sept. 6....										
# But what this could mean for Estonia's chances of joining the European										
# Union are still unclear.  In 1994, the EU declared summer time compulsory										
# for all member states until 2001.  Brussels has yet to decide what to do										
# after that.										
										
# From Mart Oruaas (2000-01-29):										
# Regulation No. 301 (1999-10-12) obsoletes previous regulation										
# No. 206 (1998-09-22) and thus sticks Estonia to +02:00 GMT for all										
# the year round.  The regulation is effective 1999-11-01.										
										
# From Toomas Soome (2002-02-21):										
# The Estonian government has changed once again timezone politics.										
# Now we are using again EU rules.										
#										
# From Urmet Jänes (2002-03-28):

# Well, here in Helsinki we're just changing from summer time to regular one,										
# and it's supposed to change at 4am...										
										
# From Janne Snabb (2010-07-15):

# Iceland										
#										
# From Adam David (1993-11-06):										
# The name of the timezone in Iceland for system / mail / news purposes is GMT.										
#										
# (1993-12-05):										
# This material is paraphrased from the 1988 edition of the University of										
# Iceland Almanak.										
#										
# From January 1st, 1908 the whole of Iceland was standardised at 1 hour										
# behind GMT. Previously, local mean solar time was used in different parts										
# of Iceland, the almanak had been based on Reykjavik mean solar time which										
# was 1 hour and 28 minutes behind GMT.										
#										
"# ""first day of winter"" referred to [below] means the first day of the 26 weeks"										
# of winter, according to the old icelandic calendar that dates back to the										
# time the norsemen first settled Iceland.  The first day of winter is always										
# Saturday, but is not dependent on the Julian or Gregorian calendars.										
#										
# (1993-12-10):										
# I have a reference from the Oxford Icelandic-English dictionary for the										
# beginning of winter, which ties it to the ecclesiastical calendar (and thus										
# to the julian/gregorian calendar) over the period in question.										
#	the winter begins on the Saturday next before St. Luke's day									
#	(old style), or on St. Luke's day, if a Saturday.									
"# St. Luke's day ought to be traceable from ecclesiastical sources. ""old style"""										
# might be a reference to the Julian calendar as opposed to Gregorian, or it										
# might mean something else (???).										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-11-22):

# Italy										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):										
# Sicily and Sardinia each had their own time zones from 1866 to 1893,										
# called Palermo Time (+00:53:28) and Cagliari Time (+00:36:32).										
# During World War II, German-controlled Italy used German time.										
# But these events all occurred before the 1970 cutoff,										
# so record only the time in Rome.										
#										
# From Michael Deckers (2016-10-24):										
# http://www.ac-ilsestante.it/MERIDIANE/ora_legale quotes a law of 1893-08-10										
"# ... [translated as] ""The preceding dispositions will enter into"										
# force at the instant at which, according to the time specified in										
"# the 1st article, the 1st of November 1893 will begin...."""										
#										
# From Pierpaolo Bernardi (2016-10-20):										
# The authoritative source for time in Italy is the national metrological										
# institute, which has a summary page of historical DST data at										
# http://www.inrim.it/res/tf/ora_legale_i.shtml										
# (2016-10-24):										
# http://www.renzobaldini.it/le-ore-legali-in-italia/										
# has still different data for 1944.  It divides Italy in two, as										
# there were effectively two governments at the time, north of Gothic										
# Line German controlled territory, official government RSI, and south										
# of the Gothic Line, controlled by allied armies.										
#										
# From Brian Inglis (2016-10-23):										
# Viceregal LEGISLATIVE DECREE. 14 September 1944, no. 219.										
# Restoration of Standard Time. (044U0219) (OJ 62 of 30.9.1944) ...										
# Given the R. law decreed on 1944-03-29, no. 92, by which standard time is										
"# advanced to sixty minutes later starting at hour two on 1944-04-02; ..."										
# Starting at hour three on the date 1944-09-17 standard time will be resumed.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2016-10-27):										
# Go with INRiM for DST rules, except as corrected by Inglis for 1944										
# for the Kingdom of Italy.  This is consistent with Renzo Baldini.										
# Model Rome's occupation by using C-Eur rules from 1943-09-10										
"# to 1944-06-04; although Rome was an open city during this period, it"										
# was effectively controlled by Germany.

# correct data in juridical acts and I found some juridical documents about										
# changes in the counting of time in Latvia from 1981....										
#										
# Act No. 35 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1981-01-22 ...										
# according to the Act No. 925 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1980-10-24

# ...: since the last Sunday of March 1989 in Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR,										
# Estonian SSR and Kaliningrad region of Russian Federation all year round the										
# time of 2nd time zone (Moscow time minus one hour). On the territory of Latvia

# I ... translate only the last two paragraphs:										
#    ... during second world war, in the years 1941 and 1942, Liechtenstein										
#    introduced daylight saving time, adapting to Switzerland.  From 1943 on										
#    central European time was in force throughout the year.

# From Marius Gedminas (1998-08-07):										
# I would like to inform that in this year Lithuanian time zone

# From ELTA No. 972 (2582) (1999-09-29) <http://www.elta.lt/>,										
# via Steffen Thorsen:										
# Lithuania has shifted back to the second time zone (GMT plus two hours)										
# to be valid here starting from October 31,										
# as decided by the national government on Wednesday....										
# The Lithuanian government also announced plans to consider a

# the act of the government of the Republic of Moldova Nr. 132 from 1990-05-04										
# http://lex.justice.md/viewdoc.php?action=view&view=doc&id=298782&lang=2										
# ... says that since 1990-05-06 on the territory of the Moldavian SSR										
# time would be calculated as the standard time of the second time belt										
"# plus one hour of the ""summer"" time. To implement that clocks would be"										
"# adjusted one hour backwards at 1990-05-06 2:00. After that ""summer"""										
# time would be cancelled last Sunday of September at 3:00 and										
# reintroduced last Sunday of March at 2:00.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):										
# A previous version of this database followed Shanks & Pottenger, who write										
# that Tiraspol switched to Moscow time on 1992-01-19 at 02:00.										
# However, this is most likely an error, as Moldova declared independence										
# on 1991-08-27 (the 1992-01-19 date is that of a Russian decree).										
# In early 1992 there was large-scale interethnic violence in the area										
# and it's possible that some Russophones continued to observe Moscow time.										
# But [two people] separately reported via										
# Jesper Nørgaard that as of 2001-01-24 Tiraspol was like Chisinau.										
# The Tiraspol entry has therefore been removed for now.										
#										
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-10-17):

#										
# From Tim Parenti (2011-10-19)										
# In addition, being situated at +4651+2938 would give Tiraspol										
# a pre-1880 LMT offset of 1:58:32.										
#										
# (which agrees with the earlier entry that had been removed)										
#										
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-10-26)										
# NO need to divide Moldova into two timezones at this point.										
# As of today, Transnistria (Pridnestrovie)- Tiraspol reversed its own										
# decision to abolish DST this winter.

# Howse writes that the Netherlands' railways used GMT between 1892 and 1940,										
# but for other purposes the Netherlands used Amsterdam mean time.										
										
# However, Robert H. van Gent writes (2001-04-01):										
# Howse's statement is only correct up to 1909. From 1909-05-01 (00:00:00										
# Amsterdam mean time) onwards, the whole of the Netherlands (including										
# the Dutch railways) was required by law to observe Amsterdam mean time										
# (19 minutes 32.13 seconds ahead of GMT). This had already been the										
# common practice (except for the railways) for many decades but it was										
# not until 1909 when the Dutch government finally defined this by law.										
# On 1937-07-01 this was changed to 20 minutes (exactly) ahead of GMT and										
"# was generally known as Dutch Time (""Nederlandse Tijd"")."										
#										
# (2001-04-08):										
# 1892-05-01 was the date when the Dutch railways were by law required to										
# observe GMT while the remainder of the Netherlands adhered to the common										
# practice of following Amsterdam mean time.										
#										
# (2001-04-09):										
# In 1835 the authorities of the province of North Holland requested the										
# municipal authorities of the towns and cities in the province to observe										
# Amsterdam mean time but I do not know in how many cases this request was										
# actually followed.										
#										
# From 1852 onwards the Dutch telegraph offices were by law required to										
# observe Amsterdam mean time. As the time signals from the observatory of										
# Leiden were also distributed by the telegraph system, I assume that most										
# places linked up with the telegraph (and railway) system automatically										
# adopted Amsterdam mean time.										
#										
# Although the early Dutch railway companies initially observed a variety										
# of times, most of them had adopted Amsterdam mean time by 1858 but it										
# was not until 1866 when they were all required by law to observe										
# Amsterdam mean time.

# Svalbard & Jan Mayen										
										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2001-05-01):										
# Although I could not find it explicitly, it seems that Jan Mayen and										
# Svalbard have been using the same time as Norway at least since the										
# time they were declared as parts of Norway.  Svalbard was declared										
# as a part of Norway by law of 1925-07-17 no 11, section 4 and Jan										
# Mayen by law of 1930-02-27 no 2, section 2. (From										
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19250717-011.html> and										
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19300227-002.html>).  The law/regulation										
# for normal/standard time in Norway is from 1894-06-29 no 1 (came										
# into operation on 1895-01-01) and Svalbard/Jan Mayen seem to be a										
# part of this law since 1925/1930. (From										
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-18940629-001.html>) I have not been										
# able to find if Jan Mayen used a different time zone (e.g. -0100)										
"# before 1930. Jan Mayen has only been ""inhabited"" since 1921 by"										
# Norwegian meteorologists and maybe used the same time as Norway ever										
# since 1921.  Svalbard (Arctic/Longyearbyen) has been inhabited since										
# before 1895, and therefore probably changed the local time somewhere										
# between 1895 and 1925 (inclusive).										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2013-09-04):										
#										
# Actually, Jan Mayen was never occupied by Germany during World War II,										
# so it must have diverged from Oslo time during the war, as Oslo was										
# keeping Berlin time.										
#										
# <https://www.jan-mayen.no/history.htm> says that the meteorologists										
# burned down their station in 1940 and left the island, but returned in										
# 1941 with a small Norwegian garrison and continued operations despite										
# frequent air attacks from Germans.  In 1943 the Americans established a										
"# radiolocating station on the island, called ""Atlantic City"".  Possibly"										
# the UT offset changed during the war, but I think it unlikely that										
# Jan Mayen used German daylight-saving rules.										
#										
# Svalbard is more complicated, as it was raided in August 1941 by an										
# Allied party that evacuated the civilian population to England (says										
# <http://www.bartleby.com/65/sv/Svalbard.html>).  The Svalbard FAQ										
# <http://www.svalbard.com/SvalbardFAQ.html> says that the Germans were										
# expelled on 1942-05-14.  However, small parties of Germans did return,										
"# and according to Wilhelm Dege's book ""War North of 80"" (1954)"										
# http://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/departments/UP/1-55238/1-55238-110-2.html										
# the German armed forces at the Svalbard weather station code-named										
# Haudegen did not surrender to the Allies until September 1945.										
#										
# All these events predate our cutoff date of 1970, so use Europe/Oslo										
# for these regions.

# Portugal										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-11), after a heads-up from Stephen Colebourne:										
# According to a Portuguese decree (1911-05-26)										
# https://dre.pt/application/dir/pdf1sdip/1911/05/12500/23132313.pdf										
# Lisbon was at -0:36:44.68, but switched to GMT on 1912-01-01 at 00:00.										
# Round the old offset to -0:36:45.  This agrees with Willett but disagrees										
# with Shanks, who says the transition occurred on 1911-05-24 at 00:00 for										
# Europe/Lisbon, Atlantic/Azores, and Atlantic/Madeira.										
#										
# From Rui Pedro Salgueiro (1992-11-12):										
# Portugal has recently (September, 27) changed timezone										
# (from WET to MET or CET) to harmonize with EEC.										
#										
# Martin Bruckmann (1996-02-29) reports via Peter Ilieve										
# that Portugal is reverting to 0:00 by not moving its clocks this spring.										
# The new Prime Minister was fed up with getting up in the dark in the winter.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-12):										
# IATA SSIM (1991-09) reports several 1991-09 and 1992-09 transitions										
# at 02:00u, not 01:00u.  Assume that these are typos.										
# IATA SSIM (1991/1992) reports that the Azores were at -1:00.										
"# IATA SSIM (1993-02) says +0:00; later issues (through 1996-09) say -1:00."										
# Guess that the Azores changed to EU rules in 1992 (since that's when Portugal										
# harmonized with the EU), and that they stayed +0:00 that winter.

# DSH writes that despite Decree 1,469 (1915), the change to the clocks was not										
# done every year, depending on what Spain did, because of railroad schedules.

# But now it is some months since Novosibirsk is 3 hours ahead of Moscow!										
"# I do not know why they have decided to make this change;"										
# as far as I remember it was done exactly during winter->summer switching										
# so we (Novosibirsk) simply did not switch.										
#										
# From Andrey A. Chernov (1996-10-04):										
# 'MSK' and 'MSD' were born and used initially on Moscow computers with										
# UNIX-like OSes by several developer groups (e.g. Demos group, Kiae group)....										
# The next step was the UUCP network, the Relcom predecessor										
# (used mainly for mail), and MSK/MSD was actively used there.										
#										
# From Chris Carrier (1996-10-30):										
# According to a friend of mine who rode the Trans-Siberian Railroad from										
# Moscow to Irkutsk in 1995, public air and rail transport in Russia ...										
# still follows Moscow time, no matter where in Russia it is located.										
#										
# For Grozny, Chechnya, we have the following story from										
"# John Daniszewski, ""Scavengers in the Rubble"", Los Angeles Times (2001-02-07):"										
# News - often false - is spread by word of mouth.  A rumor that it was										
# time to move the clocks back put this whole city out of sync with										
# the rest of Russia for two weeks - even soldiers stationed here began										
# enforcing curfew at the wrong time.										
#										
# From Gwillim Law (2001-06-05):										
# There's considerable evidence that Sakhalin Island used to be in										
# UTC+11, and has changed to UTC+10, in this decade.  I start with the										
# SSIM, which listed Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in zone RU10 along with Magadan										
# until February 1997, and then in RU9 with Khabarovsk and Vladivostok										
# since September 1997....  Although the Kuril Islands are										
# administratively part of Sakhalin oblast', they appear to have										
# remained on UTC+11 along with Magadan.										
										
# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-06):										
# The comments detailing the coverage of each Russian zone are meant to assist										
# with maintenance only and represent our best guesses as to which regions										
# are covered by each zone.  They are not meant to be taken as an authoritative

# From Paul Eggert (2016-08-23):										
# The Soviets switched to UT-based time in 1919.  Decree No. 59										
# (1919-02-08) http://istmat.info/node/35567 established UT-based time										
# zones, and Decree No. 147 (1919-03-29) http://istmat.info/node/35854										
# specified a transition date of 1919-07-01, apparently at 00:00 UT.										
"# No doubt only the Soviet-controlled regions switched on that date;"										
# later transitions to UT-based time in other parts of Russia are										
# taken from what appear to be guesses by Shanks.										
# (Thanks to Alexander Belopolsky for pointers to the decrees.)										
										
# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-07):										
# 11. Regions-violators, 1981-1982.										
# Wikipedia refers to										
# http://maps.monetonos.ru/maps/raznoe/Old_Maps/Old_Maps/Articles/022/3_1981.html										
# http://besp.narod.ru/nauka_1981_3.htm										
#										
# The second link provides two articles scanned from the Nauka i Zhizn										
# magazine No. 3, 1981 and a scan of the short article attributed to										
# the Trud newspaper from February 1982.  The first link provides the										
# same Nauka i Zhizn articles converted to the text form (but misses										
# time belt changes map).										
#										
# The second Nauka i Zhizn article says that in addition to										
# introduction of summer time on 1981-04-01 there are some time belt										
# border changes on 1981-10-01, mostly affecting Nenets Autonomous										
# Okrug, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Yakutia, Magadan Oblast and Chukotka										
# according to the provided map (colored one).  In addition to that										
"# ""time violators"" (regions which were not using rules of the time"										
# belts in which they were located) would not be moving off the DST on										
# 1981-10-01 to restore the decree time usage.  (Komi ASSR was										
# supposed to repeat that move in October 1982 to account for the 2										
"# hour difference.)  Map depicting ""time violators"" before 1981-10-01"										
# is also provided.										
#										
# The article from Trud says that 1981-10-01 changes caused problems										
# and some territories would be moved to pre-1981-10-01 time by not										
# moving to summer time on 1982-04-01.  Namely: Dagestan,										
# Kabardino-Balkar, Kalmyk, Komi, Mari, Mordovian, North Ossetian,										
# Tatar, Chechen-Ingush and Chuvash ASSR, Krasnodar and Stavropol										
# krais, Arkhangelsk, Vladimir, Vologda, Voronezh, Gorky, Ivanovo,										
# Kostroma, Lipetsk, Penza, Rostov, Ryazan, Tambov, Tyumen and										
# Yaroslavl oblasts, Nenets and Evenk autonomous okrugs, Khatangsky										
# district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  As a result Evenk Autonomous										
# Okrug and Khatangsky district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug would end										
# up on Moscow+4, Tyumen Oblast on Moscow+2 and the rest on Moscow										
# time.										
#										
# http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt										
# attributes the 1982 changes to the Act of the Council of Ministers										
# of the USSR No. 126 from 18.02.1982.  1980-925.txt also adds										
# Udmurtia to the list of affected territories and lists Khatangsky										
# district separately from Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  Probably erroneously.										
#										
# The affected territories are currently listed under Europe/Moscow,										
# Asia/Yekaterinburg and Asia/Krasnoyarsk.										
#										
# 12. Udmurtia										
# The fact that Udmurtia is depicted as a violator in the Nauka i										
# Zhizn article hints at Izhevsk being on different time from										
# Kuybyshev before 1981-10-01. Udmurtia is not mentioned in the 1989 act.										
# http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt										
# implies Udmurtia was on Moscow time after 1982-04-01.										
# Wikipedia implies Udmurtia being on Moscow+1 until 1991.										
#										
# ...										
#										
# All Russian zones are supposed to have by default a -1 change at										
# 1991-03-31 2:00 (cancellation of the decree time in the USSR) and a +1										
# change at 1992-01-19 2:00 (restoration of the decree time in Russia).										
#										
# There were some exceptions, though.										
# Wikipedia says newspapers listed Astrakhan, Saratov, Kirov, Volgograd,										
# Izhevsk, Grozny, Kazan and Samara as such exceptions for the 1992										
# change. (Different newspapers providing different lists. And some										
# lists found in the internet are quite wild.)										
#										
# And apparently some exceptions were reverted in the last moment.										
# http://www.kaliningradka.ru/site_pc/cherez/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=40091										
# says that Kaliningrad decided not to be an exception 2 days before the										
# 1991-03-31 switch and one person at										
# https://izhevsk.ru/forum_light_message/50/682597-m8369040.html										
# says he remembers that Samara opted out of the 1992-01-19 exception										
# 2 days before the switch.

# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):										
# Given the above, we appear to be missing some Zone entries for the										
# chaotic early 1980s in Russia.  It's not clear what these entries										
# should be.  For now, sweep this under the rug and just document the										
# time in Moscow.										
										
# From Vladimir Karpinsky (2014-07-08):										
# LMT in Moscow (before Jul 3, 1916) is 2:30:17, that was defined by Moscow										
"# Observatory (coordinates: 55 deg. 45'29.70"", 37 deg. 34'05.30"")...."										
# LMT in Moscow since Jul 3, 1916 is 2:31:01 as a result of new standard.										
# (The info is from the book by Byalokoz ... p. 18.)										
# The time in St. Petersburg as capital of Russia was defined by										
# Pulkov observatory, near St. Petersburg.  In 1916 LMT Moscow										
# was synchronized with LMT St. Petersburg (+30 minutes), (Pulkov observatory										
"# coordinates: 59 deg. 46'18.70"", 30 deg. 19'40.70"") so 30 deg. 19'40.70"" >"										
# 2h01m18.7s = 2:01:19.  LMT Moscow = LMT St.Petersburg + 30m 2:01:19 + 0:30 =										
# 2:31:19 ...										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-08):										
# Milne does not list Moscow, but suggests that its time might be listed in										
# Résumés mensuels et annuels des observations météorologiques (1895).										
# Presumably this is OCLC 85825704, a journal published with parallel text in										
"# Russian and French.  This source has not been located; go with Karpinsky."

# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-06):										
# Asia/Srednekolymsk covers parts of (14, RU-SA) Sakha (Yakutia) Republic:										
# 14-01	****	Abyysky District								
# 14-03	****	Allaikhovsky District								
# 14-08	****	Verkhnekolymsky District								
# 14-17	****	Momsky District								
# 14-20	****	Nizhnekolymsky District

#										
# ...and parts of (65, RU-SAK) Sakhalin Oblast:										
# 65-11	****	Severo-Kurilsky District (North Kuril Islands)								
										
# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-02):										
# Oymyakonsky District of Sakha Republic (represented by Ust-Nera), along with										
# most of Sakhalin Oblast (represented by Sakhalin) will be moving to UTC+10 on										
"# 2014-10-26 to stay aligned with VLAT/SAKT; however, Severo-Kurilsky District"										
# of the Sakhalin Oblast (also known as the North Kuril Islands, represented by										
# Severo-Kurilsk) will remain on UTC+11.										
										
# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-06):										
# Assume North Kuril Islands have history like Magadan before 2011-03-27.										
# There is a decent chance this is wrong, in which case a new zone										
# Asia/Severo-Kurilsk would become necessary.										
#										
# Srednekolymsk and Zyryanka are the most populous places amongst these										
# districts, but have very similar populations.  In fact, Wikipedia currently										
# lists them both as having 3528 people, exactly 1668 males and 1860 females										
# each!  (Yikes!)										
# https://en.wikipedia.org/w/?title=Srednekolymsky_District&oldid=603435276										
# https://en.wikipedia.org/w/?title=Verkhnekolymsky_District&oldid=594378493										
# Assume this is a mistake, albeit an amusing one.										
#										
# Looking at censuses, the populations of the two municipalities seem to have										
# fluctuated recently.  Zyryanka was more populous than Srednekolymsk in the										
# 1989 and 2002 censuses, but Srednekolymsk was more populous in the most										
# recent (2010) census, 3525 to 3170.  (See pages 195 and 197 of										
# http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/Documents/Vol1/pub-01-05.pdf										
# in Russian.)  In addition, Srednekolymsk appears to be a much older										
# settlement and the population of Zyryanka seems to be declining.										
# Go with Srednekolymsk.

# From Alois Treindl (2008-12-17):										
# I have researched the DST usage in Switzerland during the 1940ies.										
#										
# As I wrote in an earlier message, I suspected the current tzdata values										
# to be wrong. This is now verified.										
#										
# I have found copies of the original ruling by the Swiss Federal										
# government, in 'Eidgenössische Gesetzessammlung 1941 and 1942' (Swiss										
# federal law collection)...										
#										
# DST began on Monday 5 May 1941, 1:00 am by shifting the clocks to 2:00 am										
# DST ended on Monday 6 Oct 1941, 2:00 am by shifting the clocks to 1:00 am.										
#										
# DST began on Monday, 4 May 1942 at 01:00 am										
# DST ended on Monday, 5 Oct 1942 at 02:00 am										
#										
# There was no DST in 1940, I have checked the law collection carefully.										
# It is also indicated by the fact that the 1942 entry in the law										
# collection points back to 1941 as a reference, but no reference to any										
# other years are made.										
#										
# Newspaper articles I have read in the archives on 6 May 1941 reported										
# about the introduction of DST (Sommerzeit in German) during the previous										
# night as an absolute novelty, because this was the first time that such										
# a thing had happened in Switzerland.										
#										
# I have also checked 1916, because one book source (Gabriel, Traité de										
# l'heure dans le monde) claims that Switzerland had DST in 1916. This is										
# false, no official document could be found. Probably Gabriel got misled										
# by references to Germany, which introduced DST in 1916 for the first time.										
#										
# The tzdata rules for Switzerland must be changed to:										
# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       May     Mon>=1  1:00    1:00    S										
# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       Oct     Mon>=1  2:00    0       -										
#										
# The 1940 rules must be deleted.										
#										
# One further detail for Switzerland, which is probably out of scope for										
# most users of tzdata: The [Europe/Zurich zone] ...										
# describes all of Switzerland correctly, with the exception of										
# the Canton de Genève (Geneva, Genf). Between 1848 and 1894 Geneva did not										
# follow Bern Mean Time but kept its own local mean time.										
# To represent this, an extra zone would be needed.										
#										
# From Alois Treindl (2013-09-11):										
# The Federal regulations say										
# https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20071096/index.html

# 1851-11-23, and an official implementation notice was published 1853-07-16

# But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions

# one year later, Denmark ended DST on 'Oct 1' instead of 'Sep										
# lastSun' in 1981 - I don't know how they handle now.

# Finally, DST ist always from 'Apr 1' to 'Oct 1' in the

# In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that										
# the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982										
# the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in										
# the Sov[i]et Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europe[a]n switch										
# dates...										
#										
"# It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g."										
# Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST...										
# Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not										
# all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations										
# occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always										
# assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the										
"# case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours"										
# in advance of normal time.

###############################################################################										
										
# United States										
										
# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):										
# Howse writes (pp 121-125) that time zones were invented by										
# Professor Charles Ferdinand Dowd (1825-1904),										
# Principal of Temple Grove Ladies' Seminary (Saratoga Springs, NY).										
"# His pamphlet ""A System of National Time for Railroads"" (1870)"										
# was the result of his proposals at the Convention of Railroad Trunk Lines										
# in New York City (1869-10).  His 1870 proposal was based on Washington, DC,										
# but in 1872-05 he moved the proposed origin to Greenwich.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2016-09-21):										
# Dowd's proposal left many details unresolved, such as where to draw										
# lines between time zones.  The key individual who made time zones										
# work in the US was William Frederick Allen - railway engineer,										
# managing editor of the Travelers' Guide, and secretary of the										
# General Time Convention, a railway standardization group.  Allen										
# spent months in dialogs with scientific and railway leaders,										
# developed a workable plan to institute time zones, and presented it										
# to the General Time Convention on 1883-04-11, saying that his plan										
"# meant ""local time would be practically abolished"" - a plus for"										
# railway scheduling.  By the next convention on 1883-10-11 nearly all										
# railroads had agreed and it took effect on 1883-11-18 at 12:00.										
"# That Sunday was called the ""day of two noons"", as the eastern parts"										
# of the new zones observed noon twice.  Allen witnessed the										
# transition in New York City, writing:										
#										
#   I heard the bells of St. Paul's strike on the old time.  Four										
#   minutes later, obedient to the electrical signal from the Naval										
#   Observatory ... the time-ball made its rapid descent, the chimes										
#   of old Trinity rang twelve measured strokes, and local time was										
#   abandoned, probably forever.										
#										
# Most of the US soon followed suit.  See:										
"# Bartky IR. The adoption of standard time. Technol Cult 1989 Jan;30(1):25-56."										
# http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3105430										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2005-04-16):										
# That 1883 transition occurred at 12:00 new time, not at 12:00 old time.										
# See p 46 of David Prerau, Seize the daylight, Thunder's Mouth Press (2005).										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):										
# A good source for time zone historical data in the US is										
# Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),										
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).										
"# Make sure you have the errata sheet; the book is somewhat useless without it."										
# It is the source for most of the pre-1991 US entries below.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):										
# Daylight Saving Time was first suggested as a joke by Benjamin Franklin										
"# in his whimsical essay ""An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost"										
"# of Light"" published in the Journal de Paris (1784-04-26)."										
# Not everyone is happy with the results:										
#										
#	I don't really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some									
#	agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving									
#	daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind.									
#	I even object to the implication that I am wasting something									
#	valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen.  As an admirer									
#	of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to									
#	reduce my time for enjoying it.  At the back of the Daylight Saving									
#	scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager									
#	to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make									
#	them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves.

"# Shanks says that DST was called ""War Time"" in the US in 1918 and 1919."										
# However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which										
# was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently										
"# time was just called ""Standard Time"" or ""Daylight Saving Time""."										
										
# From Arthur David Olson:										
# US Daylight Saving Time ended on the last Sunday of *October* in 1974.										
# See, for example, the front page of the Saturday, 1974-10-26										
# and Sunday, 1974-10-27 editions of the Washington Post.										
										
# From Arthur David Olson:										
# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of										
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.										
										
# From Arthur David Olson (2000-09-25):										
# Last night I heard part of a rebroadcast of a 1945 Arch Oboler radio drama.										
"# In the introduction, Oboler spoke of ""Eastern Peace Time."""										
# An AltaVista search turned up:										
# https://web.archive.org/web/20000926032210/http://rowayton.org/rhs/hstaug45.html										
"# ""When the time is announced over the radio now, it is 'Eastern Peace"										
"# Time' instead of the old familiar 'Eastern War Time.'  Peace is wonderful."""										
# (August 1945) by way of confirmation.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2017-09-23):										
# This was the V-J Day issue of the Clamdigger, a Rowayton, CT newsletter.										
										
# From Joseph Gallant citing										
# George H. Douglas, _The Early Days of Radio Broadcasting_ (1987):										
# At 7 P.M. (Eastern War Time) [on 1945-08-14], the networks were set										
# to switch to London for Attlee's address, but the American people										
# never got to hear his speech live. According to one press account,										
# CBS' Bob Trout was first to announce the word of Japan's surrender,										
# but a few seconds later, NBC, ABC and Mutual also flashed the word										
# of surrender, all of whom interrupting the bells of Big Ben in										
# London which were to precede Mr. Attlee's speech.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09): It was Robert St John, not Bob Trout.  From										
# Myrna Oliver's obituary of St John on page B16 of today's Los Angeles Times:										
#										
# ... a war-weary U.S. clung to radios, awaiting word of Japan's surrender.										
# Any announcement from Asia would reach St. John's New York newsroom on a										
# wire service teletype machine, which had prescribed signals for major news.										
# Associated Press, for example, would ring five bells before spewing out										
"# typed copy of an important story, and 10 bells for news ""of transcendental"										
"# importance."""										
#										
# On Aug. 14, stalling while talking steadily into the NBC networks' open										
# microphone, St. John heard five bells and waited only to hear a sixth bell,										
"# before announcing confidently: ""Ladies and gentlemen, World War II is over."										
"# The Japanese have agreed to our surrender terms."""										
#										
# He had scored a 20-second scoop on other broadcasters.										
										
# From Arthur David Olson (2005-08-22):										
"# Paul has been careful to use the ""US"" rules only in those locations"										
"# that are part of the United States; this reflects the real scope of"										
"# U.S. government action.  So even though the ""US"" rules have changed"										
# in the latest release, other countries won't be affected.

# From Paul Eggert (2016-08-20):										
# In early February 1948, in response to California's electricity shortage,										
# PG&E changed power frequency from 60 to 59.5 Hz during daylight hours,										
# causing electric clocks to lose six minutes per day.  (This did not change

# Working Paper No. 8, Institute of Governmental Studies, UC Berkeley,										
# 1973-11.  https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8x22k30c										
#										
# In another measure to save electricity, DST was instituted from 1948-03-14										
# at 02:01 to 1949-01-16 at 02:00, with the governor having the option to move										
# the fallback transition earlier.  See pages 3-4 of:										
# http://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1948/48Vol1_Chapters.pdf										
#										
# In response:										
#										
#   Governor Warren received a torrent of objecting mail, and it is not too much										
#   to speculate that the objections to Daylight Saving Time were one important										
#   factor in the defeat of the Dewey-Warren Presidential ticket in California.										
#     -- Ross, p 25										
#										
# On December 8 the governor exercised the option, setting the date to January 1										
# (LA Times 1948-12-09).  The transition time was 02:00 (LA Times 1949-01-01).										
#										
# Despite the controversy, in 1949 California voters approved Proposition 12,										
# which established DST from April's last Sunday at 01:00 until September's

# Alaska										
# AK%sT is the modern abbreviation for -09 per USNO.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2017-06-15):										
# Howse writes that Alaska switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar,										
# and from east-of-GMT to west-of-GMT days, when the US bought it from Russia.										
# On Friday, 1867-10-18 (Gregorian), at precisely 15:30 local time, the										
# Russian forts and fleet at Sitka fired salutes to mark the ceremony of										
# formal transfer.  See the Sacramento Daily Union (1867-11-14), p 3, col 2.										
# https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SDU18671114.2.12.1										
# Sitka workers did not change their calendars until Sunday, 1867-10-20,										
# and so celebrated two Sundays that week.  See: Ahllund T (tr Hallamaa P).										
"# From the memoirs of a Finnish workman. Alaska History. 2006 Fall;21(2):1-25."										
# http://alaskahistoricalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ahllund-2006-Memoirs-of-a-Finnish-Workman.pdf										
# Include only the time zone part of this transition, ignoring the switch										
# from Julian to Gregorian, since we can't represent the Julian calendar.										
#										
# As far as we know, of the locations mentioned below only Sitka was										
# permanently inhabited in 1867 by anyone using either calendar.										
# (Yakutat was colonized by the Russians in 1799, but the settlement was										
# destroyed in 1805 by a Yakutat-kon war party.)  Many of Alaska's inhabitants										
# were unaware of the US acquisition of Alaska, much less of any calendar or										
# time change.  However, the Russian-influenced part of Alaska did observe										
# Russian time, and it is more accurate to model this than to ignore it.										
"# The database format requires an exact transition time; use the Russian"										
# salute as a somewhat-arbitrary time for the formal transfer of control for										
"# all of Alaska.  Sitka's UTC offset is -9:01:13; adjust its 15:30 to the"										
# local times of other Alaskan locations so that they change simultaneously.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-18):										
# One opinion of the early-1980s turmoil in Alaska over time zones and										
# daylight saving time appeared as graffiti on a Juneau airport wall:										
"# ""Welcome to Juneau.  Please turn your watch back to the 19th century."""										
# See: Turner W. Alaska's four time zones now two. NY Times 1983-11-01.

# http://alaskahistoricalsociety.org/discover-alaska/glimpses-of-the-past/keeping-time-in-alaska/										
										
# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-01):										
"# Here's database-relevant material from the 2001 ""Alaska History"" article:"										
#										
# On September 20 [1979]...DOT...officials decreed that on April 27,										
# 1980, Juneau and other nearby communities would move to Yukon Time.										
# Sitka, Petersburg, Wrangell, and Ketchikan, however, would remain on										
# Pacific Time.										
#										
# ...on September 22, 1980, DOT Secretary Neil E. Goldschmidt rescinded the										
# Department's September 1979 decision. Juneau and other communities in										
# northern Southeast reverted to Pacific Time on October 26.										
#										
# On October 28 [1983]...the Metlakatla Indian Community Council voted										
# unanimously to keep the reservation on Pacific Time.										
#										
# According to DOT official Joanne Petrie, Indian reservations are not										
# bound to follow time zones imposed by neighboring jurisdictions.										
#										
# (The last is consistent with how the database now handles the Navajo										
# Nation.)										
										
# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-09):										
# I just spoke by phone with a staff member at the Metlakatla Indian										
# Community office (using contact information available at										
# http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_name=Metlakatla										
"# It's shortly after 1:00 here on the east coast of the United States;"										
# the staffer said it was shortly after 10:00 there. When I asked whether										
# that meant they were on Pacific time, they said no - they were on their										
"# own time. I asked about daylight saving; they said it wasn't used. I"										
# did not inquire about practices in the past.										
										
# From Arthur David Olson (2011-08-17):										
# For lack of better information, assume that Metlakatla's										
# abandonment of use of daylight saving resulted from the 1983 vote.										
										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2015-11-09):										
# It seems Metlakatla did go off PST on Sunday, November 1, changing										
# their time to AKST and are going to follow Alaska's DST, switching										
# between AKST and AKDT from now on....

# (1999-01-29) via WKYM-101.7:										
# Clinton County has joined Wayne County in asking the DoT to change from										
# the Central to the Eastern time zone....  The Wayne County government made										
# the same request in December.  And while Russell County officials have not										
# taken action, the majority of respondents to a poll conducted there in										
"# August indicated they would like to change to ""fast time"" also."										
# The three Lake Cumberland counties are the farthest east of any U.S.										
# location in the Central time zone.										
#										
# From Rich Wales (2000-08-29):										
# After prolonged debate, and despite continuing deep differences of opinion,										
# Wayne County (central Kentucky) is switching from Central (-0600) to Eastern										
"# (-0500) time.  They won't ""fall back"" this year.  See Sara Shipley,"

#										
# From Paul Eggert (2001-07-17):										
# We don't know where the line used to be within Kearny County, KS,										
# so omit that change for now.										
# See America/Indiana/Knox for the Starke County, IN change.										
# See America/North_Dakota/Center for the Oliver County, ND change.										
# West Wendover, NV officially switched from Pacific to mountain time on										
# 1999-10-31.  See the										
# Federal Register 64, 203 (1999-10-21), pp 56705-56707.										
# https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-10-21/html/99-27240.htm										
# However, the Federal Register says that West Wendover already operated										
"# on mountain time, and the rule merely made this official;"										
# hence a separate tz entry is not needed.										
										
# Michigan										
#										
# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):										
# Michigan didn't observe DST from 1968 to 1973.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):										
# Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885-09-18,										
# but Howse writes (pp 124-125, referring to Popular Astronomy, 1901-01)										
# that Detroit kept										
#										
#	local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should									
#	be put back twenty-eight minutes to Central Standard Time.  Half the									
#	city obeyed, half refused.  After considerable debate, the decision									
#	was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time.  A derisive offer to									
#	erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the									
#	Committee on Sewers.  Then, in 1905, Central time was adopted									
#	by city vote.									
#										
# This story is too entertaining to be false, so go with Howse over Shanks.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):										
"# Garland (1927) writes ""Cleveland and Detroit advanced their clocks"										
"# one hour in 1914.""  This change is not in Shanks.  We have no more"										
# info, so omit this for now.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2017-07-26):										
# Although Shanks says Detroit observed DST in 1967 from 06-14 00:01										
# until 10-29 00:01, I now see multiple reports that this is incorrect.										
# For example, according to a 50-year anniversary report about the 1967										
"# Detroit riots and a major-league doubleheader on 1967-07-23, ""By the time"										
# the last fly ball of the doubleheader settled into the glove of leftfielder										
# Lenny Green, it was after 7 p.m.  Detroit did not observe daylight saving										
# time, so light was already starting to fail.  Twilight was made even deeper										
# by billowing columns of smoke that ascended in an unbroken wall north of the										
"# ballpark.""  See: Dow B. Detroit '67: As violence unfolded, Tigers played two"

# In the first of Tammy Hardwick's articles										
# http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260										
# she quotes the Friday November 1/1918 edition of the Creston Review.										
# The quote includes these two statements:										
# 'Sunday the CPR went back to the old system of time...'										
# '... The daylight saving scheme was dropped all over Canada at the same time,'										
# These statements refer to a transition from daylight time to standard time										
# that occurred nationally on Sunday October 27/1918.  This transition was										
# also documented in the Saturday October 26/1918 edition of the Toronto Star.										
										
# In light of that evidence, we alter the date from the earlier believed										
# Oct 31, to Oct 27, 1918 (and Sunday is a more likely transition day										
# than Thursday) in all Canadian rulesets.

# From Paul Eggert (1997-10-17):										
# Mark Brader writes that an article in the 1997-10-14 Toronto Star										
# says that Atikokan, Ontario currently does not observe DST,										
# but will vote on 11-10 whether to use EST/EDT.										
# He also writes that the Ontario Time Act (1990, Chapter T.9)										
# http://www.gov.on.ca/MBS/english/publications/statregs/conttext.html										
# says that Ontario east of 90W uses EST/EDT, and west of 90W uses CST/CDT.										
# Officially Atikokan is therefore on CST/CDT, and most likely this report										
# concerns a non-official time observed as a matter of local practice.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):										
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Atikokan, Pickle Lake, and										
# New Osnaburgh observe CST all year, that Big Trout Lake observes										
# CST/CDT, and that Upsala and Shebandowan observe EST/EDT, all in										
# violation of the official Ontario rules.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):										
# Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the										
# 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:										
#										
#	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.									
#	This means they spend about half the time on central time and									
#	the other half on eastern time.									
#										
#	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.									
#										
#	The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern									
#	"Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada,"" he"									
#	"said.  ""I don't see any changes happening here."""									
#										
"# Walton also writes ""Supposedly Pickle Lake and Mishkeegogamang"										
"# [New Osnaburgh] follow the same practice."""										
										
# From Garry McKinnon (2006-07-14) via Chris Walton:										
# I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory										
# and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he										
# can say for certain that Atikokan has been practicing the current										
# time keeping since 1952, at least.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):										
# Shanks & Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River										
# ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from										
# McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan										
# switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time										
# ended.  This matches the old (less-populous) America/Coral_Harbour										
# entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move										
# America/Coral_Harbour to the 'backward' file.										
										
# From Mark Brader (2010-03-06):										
#										
# Currently the database has:										
#										
# # Ontario										
#										
# # From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):										
# # Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of Ontario has been like										
# # Toronto.										
# # Thunder Bay skipped DST in 1973.										
"# # Many smaller locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1974;"										
# # Nipigon (EST) and Rainy River (CST) are the largest that we know of.										
#										
# In the (Toronto) Globe and Mail for Saturday, 1955-09-24, in the bottom										
# right corner of page 1, it says that Toronto will return to standard										
# time at 2 am Sunday morning (which agrees with the database), and that:										
#										
#     The one-hour setback will go into effect throughout most of Ontario,										
#     except in areas like Windsor which remains on standard time all year.										
#										
# Windsor is, of course, a lot larger than Nipigon.										
#										
# I only came across this incidentally.  I don't know if Windsor began										
# observing DST when Detroit did, or in 1974, or on some other date.										
#										
# By the way, the article continues by noting that:										
#										
#     Some cities in the United States have pushed the deadline back										
#     three weeks and will change over from daylight saving in October.										
										
# From Arthur David Olson (2010-07-17):										
#										
"# ""Standard Time and Time Zones in Canada"" appeared in"										
# The Journal of The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada,										
# volume 26, number 2 (February 1932) and, as of 2010-07-17,										
# was available at										
# http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1932JRASC..26...49S										
#										
# It includes the text below (starting on page 57):										
#										
#   A list of the places in Canada using daylight saving time would										
# require yearly revision. From information kindly furnished by										
# the provincial governments and by the postmasters in many cities										
# and towns, it is found that the following places used daylight sav-										
# ing in 1930. The information for the province of Quebec is definite,										
# for the other provinces only approximate:										
#										
#	Province	Daylight saving time used								
# Prince Edward Island	Not used.									
# Nova Scotia		In Halifax only.								
# New Brunswick		In St. John only.								
# Quebec		In the following places:

#			Longueuil	Greenfield Park						
#			Arvida		Waterloo					
#			Chambly-Canton	Beaulieu						
#			Melbourne	La Tuque						
#			St. Théophile	Buckingham						
# Ontario		Used generally in the cities and towns along

# Manitoba		Not used.								
# Saskatchewan		In Regina only.								
# Alberta		Not used.								
# British Columbia	Not used.

# Saskatchewan										
										
# From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):										
# The first actual adoption of DST in Canada was at the municipal										
"# level.  As the [Toronto] Star put it (1912-06-07), ""While people"										
# elsewhere have long been talking of legislation to save daylight,										
"# the city of Moose Jaw [Saskatchewan] has acted on its own hook."""										
# DST in Moose Jaw began on Saturday, 1912-06-01 (no time mentioned:										
"# presumably late evening, as below), and would run until ""the end of"										
"# the summer"".  The discrepancy between municipal time and railroad"										
# time was noted.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2003-07-27):										
"# Willett (1914-03) notes that DST ""has been in operation ... in the"										
"# City of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, for one year."""										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):										
# Shanks & Pottenger say that since 1970 this region has mostly been as Regina.										
# Some western towns (e.g. Swift Current) switched from MST/MDT to CST in 1972.										
# Other western towns (e.g. Lloydminster) are like Edmonton.										
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Denare Beach and Creighton										
# are like Winnipeg, in violation of Saskatchewan law.										
										
# From W. Jones (1992-11-06):										
# The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the										
# provincial archives, and the provincial Community Services department.										
# A precise history would require digging through newspaper archives, and										
# since you didn't say what you wanted, I didn't bother.										
#										
# Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years										
# the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated										
# their affiliations in one direction or the other.  In 1965 a provincial										
# referendum favoured legislating common time practices.										
#										
# On 15 April 1966 the Time Act (c. T-14, Revised Statutes of										
# Saskatchewan 1978) was proclaimed, and established that the eastern										
# part of Saskatchewan would use CST year round, that districts in										
# northwest Saskatchewan would by default follow CST but could opt to										
# follow Mountain Time rules (thus 1 hour difference in the winter and										
# zero in the summer), and that districts in southwest Saskatchewan would										
# by default follow MT but could opt to follow CST.										
#										
# It took a few years for the dust to settle (I know one story of a town										
# on one time zone having its school in another, such that a mom had to										
# serve her family lunch in two shifts), but presently it seems that only										
# a few towns on the border with Alberta (e.g. Lloydminster) follow MT										
"# rules any more; all other districts appear to have used CST year round"										
# since sometime in the 1960s.										
										
# From Chris Walton (2006-06-26):										
# The Saskatchewan time act which was last updated in 1996 is about 30 pages										
# long and rather painful to read.

# British Columbia										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):										
# Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of this region has										
# been like Vancouver.										
# Dawson Creek uses MST.  Much of east BC is like Edmonton.										
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Creston is like Dawson Creek.										
										
# It seems though that (re: Creston) is not entirely correct:										
										
# From Chris Walton (2011-12-01):										
# There are two areas within the Canadian province of British Columbia										
# that do not currently observe daylight saving:										
# a) The Creston Valley (includes the town of Creston and surrounding area)										
# b) The eastern half of the Peace River Regional District										
# (includes the cities of Dawson Creek and Fort St. John)										
										
# Earlier this year I stumbled across a detailed article about the time										
"# keeping history of Creston; it was written by Tammy Hardwick who is the"										
# manager of the Creston & District Museum. The article was written in May 2009.										
# http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260										
# According to the article, Creston has not changed its clocks since June 1918.										
# i.e. Creston has been stuck on UTC-7 for 93 years.										
# Dawson Creek, on the other hand, changed its clocks as recently as April 1972.										
										
# Unfortunately the exact date for the time change in June 1918 remains										
# unknown and will be difficult to ascertain.  I e-mailed Tammy a few months										
# ago to ask if Sunday June 2 was a reasonable guess.  She said it was just										
# as plausible as any other date (in June).  She also said that after writing										
"# the article she had discovered another time change in 1916; this is the"										
# subject of another article which she wrote in October 2010.										
# http://www.creston.museum.bc.ca/index.php?module=comments&uop=view_comment&cm+id=56										
										
# Here is a summary of the three clock change events in Creston's history:										
# 1. 1884 or 1885: adoption of Mountain Standard Time (GMT-7)										
# Exact date unknown										
# 2. Oct 1916: switch to Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8)										
"# Exact date in October unknown; Sunday October 1 is a reasonable guess."										
# 3. June 1918: switch to Pacific Daylight Time (GMT-7)										
"# Exact date in June unknown; Sunday June 2 is a reasonable guess."										
# note 1:										
# On Oct 27/1918 when daylight saving ended in the rest of Canada,										
# Creston did not change its clocks.										
# note 2:										
# During WWII when the Federal Government legislated a mandatory clock change,										
# Creston did not oblige.										
# note 3:										
# There is no guarantee that Creston will remain on Mountain Standard Time										
# (UTC-7) forever.										
# The subject was debated at least once this year by the town Council.										
# http://www.bclocalnews.com/kootenay_rockies/crestonvalleyadvance/news/116760809.html										
										
# During a period WWII, summer time (Daylight saying) was mandatory in Canada.										
# In Creston, that was handled by shifting the area to PST (-8:00) then applying										
# summer time to cause the offset to be -7:00, the same as it had been before										
# the change.  It can be argued that the timezone abbreviation during this										
# period should be PDT rather than MST, but that doesn't seem important enough										
# (to anyone) to further complicate the rules.										
										
# The transition dates (and times) are guesses.										
										
# From Matt Johnson (2015-09-21):										
# Fort Nelson, BC, Canada will cancel DST this year.  So while previously they										
# were aligned with America/Vancouver, they're now aligned with										
# America/Dawson_Creek.										
# http://www.northernrockies.ca/EN/meta/news/archives/2015/northern-rockies-time-change.html										
#										
# From Tim Parenti (2015-09-23):										
# This requires a new zone for the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality,										
# America/Fort_Nelson.  The resolution of 2014-12-08 was reached following a										
# 2014-11-15 poll with nearly 75% support.  Effectively, the municipality has										
# been on MST (-0700) like Dawson Creek since it advanced its clocks on										
# 2015-03-08.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2015-09-23):										
# Shanks says Fort Nelson did not observe DST in 1946, unlike Vancouver.

#										
# From Antoine Leca (1999-09-06):										
# We then need to create a new timezone for the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut

# From Paul Eggert (1999-09-20):										
# Basic Facts: The New Territory										
# http://www.nunavut.com/basicfacts/english/basicfacts_1territory.html										
# (1999) reports that Pangnirtung operates on eastern time,										
# and that Coral Harbour does not observe DST.  We don't know when										
"# Pangnirtung switched to eastern time; we'll guess 1995."										
										
# From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):										
# On October 31, when the rest of Nunavut went to Central time,										
# Pangnirtung wobbled.  Here is the result of their wobble:										
#										
# The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Central Time:										
#										
#	First Air, Power Corp, Nunavut Construction, Health Center, RCMP,									
#	Eastern Arctic National Parks, A & D Specialist									
#										
# The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Eastern Time:										
#										
#	Hamlet office, All other businesses, Both schools, Airport operator									
#										
# This has made for an interesting situation there, which warranted the news.										
# No one there that I spoke with seems concerned, or has plans to										
# change the local methods of keeping time, as it evidently does not										
# really interfere with any activities or make things difficult locally.										
# They plan to celebrate New Year's turn-over twice, one hour apart,										
# so it appears that the situation will last at least that long.										
"# The Nunavut Intergovernmental Affairs hopes that they will ""come to"										
"# their senses"", but the locals evidently don't see any problem with"										
# the current state of affairs.										
										
# From Michaela Rodrigue, writing in the										
# Nunatsiaq News (1999-11-19):										
# http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/nunavut991130/nvt91119_17.html										
# Clyde River, Pangnirtung and Sanikiluaq now operate with two time zones,										
# central - or Nunavut time - for government offices, and eastern time										
# for municipal offices and schools....  Igloolik [was similar but then]										
# made the switch to central time on Saturday, Nov. 6.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):										
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) say the following, but we lack histories										
# for these potential new Zones.										
#										
# The Canadian Forces station at Alert uses Eastern Time while the										
# handful of residents at the Eureka weather station [in the Central										
# zone] skip daylight savings.  Baffin Island, which is crossed by the										
# Central, Eastern and Atlantic Time zones only uses Eastern Time.										
# Gjoa Haven, Taloyoak and Pelly Bay all use Mountain instead of										
# Central Time and Southampton Island [in the Central zone] is not										
# required to use daylight savings.										
										
# From <http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/nunavut001130/nvt21110_02.html>										
# Nunavut now has two time zones (2000-11-10):										
# The Nunavut government would allow its employees in Kugluktuk and										
# Cambridge Bay to operate on central time year-round, putting them										
# one hour behind the rest of Nunavut for six months during the winter.										
# At the end of October the two communities had rebelled against										
# Nunavut's unified time zone, refusing to shift to eastern time with										
# the rest of the territory for the winter.  Cambridge Bay remained on										
# central time, while Kugluktuk, even farther west, reverted to										
# mountain time, which they had used before the advent of Nunavut's										
# unified time zone in 1999.										
#										
# From Rives McDow (2001-01-20), quoting the Nunavut government:										
# The preceding decision came into effect at midnight, Saturday Nov 4, 2000.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2000-12-04):										
# Let's just keep track of the official times for now.										
										
# From Rives McDow (2001-03-07):										
# The premier of Nunavut has issued a ministerial statement advising										
# that effective 2001-04-01, the territory of Nunavut will revert										
# back to three time zones (mountain, central, and eastern).  Of the										
# cities in Nunavut, Coral Harbor is the only one that I know of that										
# has said it will not observe dst, staying on EST year round.  I'm										
# checking for more info, and will get back to you if I come up with										
# more.										
# [Also see <http://www.nunatsiaq.com/nunavut/nvt10309_06.html> (2001-03-09).]										
										
# From Gwillim Law (2005-05-21):										
# According to ...										
# http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/geomap.asp										
# (from a 1998 Canadian Geographic article), the de facto and de jure time										
# for Southampton Island (at the north end of Hudson Bay) is UTC-5 all year										
# round.  Using Google, it's easy to find other websites that confirm this.										
# I wasn't able to find how far back this time regimen goes, but since it										
# predates the creation of Nunavut, it probably goes back many years....										
# The Inuktitut name of Coral Harbour is Sallit, but it's rarely used.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-17):										
# For lack of better information, assume that Southampton Island observed										
# daylight saving only during wartime.  Gwillim Law's email also										
"# mentioned maps now maintained by National Research Council Canada;"										
# see above for an up-to-date link.										
										
# From Chris Walton (2007-03-01):										
# ... the community of Resolute (located on Cornwallis Island in										
# Nunavut) moved from Central Time to Eastern Time last November.										
# Basically the community did not change its clocks at the end of										
# daylight saving....										
# http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2006-11/nov13_06none.html										
										
# From Chris Walton (2011-03-21):										
"# Back in 2007 I initiated the creation of a new ""zone file"" for Resolute"										
# Bay. Resolute Bay is a small community located about 900km north of										
# the Arctic Circle. The zone file was required because Resolute Bay had										
# decided to use UTC-5 instead of UTC-6 for the winter of 2006-2007.										
#										
# According to new information which I received last week, Resolute Bay										
# went back to using UTC-6 in the winter of 2007-2008...										
#										
# On March 11/2007 most of Canada went onto daylight saving. On March										
"# 14/2007 I phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office to do a ""time check."" I"										
# talked to somebody that was both knowledgeable and helpful. I was able										
# to confirm that Resolute Bay was still operating on UTC-5. It was										
# explained to me that Resolute Bay had been on the Eastern Time zone										
# (EST) in the winter, and was now back on the Central Time zone (CDT).										
# i.e. the time zone had changed twice in the last year but the clocks										
# had not moved. The residents had to know which time zone they were in										
# so they could follow the correct TV schedule...										
#										
# On Nov 02/2008 most of Canada went onto standard time. On Nov 03/2008 I										
# phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office...[D]ue to the challenging nature										
# of the phone call, I decided to seek out an alternate source of										
# information. I found an e-mail address for somebody by the name of										
"# Stephanie Adams whose job was listed as ""Inns North Support Officer for"										
"# Arctic Co-operatives."" I was under the impression that Stephanie lived"										
# and worked in Resolute Bay...										
#										
# On March 14/2011 I phoned the hamlet office again. I was told that										
# Resolute Bay had been using Central Standard Time over the winter of										
# 2010-2011 and that the clocks had therefore been moved one hour ahead										
# on March 13/2011. The person I talked to was aware that Resolute Bay										
# had previously experimented with Eastern Standard Time but he could not										
# tell me when the practice had stopped.										
#										
# On March 17/2011 I searched the Web to find an e-mail address of										
# somebody that might be able to tell me exactly when Resolute Bay went										
"# off Eastern Standard Time. I stumbled on the name ""Aziz Kheraj."" Aziz"										
# used to be the mayor of Resolute Bay and he apparently owns half the										
"# businesses including ""South Camp Inn."" This website has some info on"										
# Aziz:										
# http://www.uphere.ca/node/493										
#										
# I sent Aziz an e-mail asking when Resolute Bay had stopped using										
# Eastern Standard Time.										
#										
"# Aziz responded quickly with this: ""hi, The time was not changed for the"										
# 1 year only, the following year, the community went back to the old way										
"# of ""spring ahead-fall behind"" currently we are zulu plus 5 hrs and in"										
"# the winter Zulu plus 6 hrs"""										
#										
# This of course conflicted with everything I had ascertained in November 2008.										
#										
# I sent Aziz a copy of my 2008 e-mail exchange with Stephanie. Aziz										
"# responded with this: ""Hi, Stephanie lives in Winnipeg. I live here, You"										
# may want to check with the weather office in Resolute Bay or do a										
"# search on the weather through Env. Canada. web site"""										
#										
# If I had realized the Stephanie did not live in Resolute Bay I would										
# never have contacted her.  I now believe that all the information I										
# obtained in November 2008 should be ignored...										
# I apologize for reporting incorrect information in 2008.

# Mexico										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-12-07):										
# The Investigation and Analysis Service of the										
# Mexican Library of Congress (MLoC) has published a										
# history of Mexican local time (in Spanish)										
# http://www.diputados.gob.mx/bibliot/publica/inveyana/polisoc/horver/index.htm										
#										
# Here are the discrepancies between Shanks & Pottenger (S&P) and the MLoC.										
# (In all cases we go with the MLoC.)										
# S&P report that Baja was at -8:00 in 1922/1923.										
# S&P say the 1930 transition in Baja was 1930-11-16.										
# S&P report no DST during summer 1931.										
# S&P report a transition at 1932-03-30 23:00, not 1932-04-01.										
										
# From Gwillim Law (2001-02-20):										
# There are some other discrepancies between the Decrees page and the										
# tz database.  I think they can best be explained by supposing that										
# the researchers who prepared the Decrees page failed to find some of										
# the relevant documents.										
										
# From Alan Perry (1996-02-15):										
# A guy from our Mexico subsidiary finally found the Presidential Decree										
# outlining the timezone changes in Mexico.										
#										
# ------------- Begin Forwarded Message -------------										
#										
# I finally got my hands on the Official Presidential Decree that sets up the										
# rules for the DST changes. The rules are:										
#										
# 1. The country is divided in 3 timezones:										
#    - Baja California Norte (the Mexico/BajaNorte TZ)										
#    - Baja California Sur, Nayarit, Sinaloa and Sonora (the Mexico/BajaSur TZ)										
#    - The rest of the country (the Mexico/General TZ)										
#										
# 2. From the first Sunday in April at 2:00 AM to the last Sunday in October										
#    at 2:00 AM, the times in each zone are as follows:										
#    BajaNorte: GMT+7										
#    BajaSur:   GMT+6										
#    General:   GMT+5										
#										
# 3. The rest of the year, the times are as follows:										
#    BajaNorte: GMT+8										
#    BajaSur:   GMT+7										
#    General:   GMT+6										
#										
# The Decree was published in Mexico's Official Newspaper on January 4th.										
#										
# -------------- End Forwarded Message --------------										
# From Paul Eggert (1996-06-12):										
# For an English translation of the decree, see										
"# ""Diario Oficial: Time Zone Changeover"" (1996-01-04)."										
# http://mexico-travel.com/extra/timezone_eng.html										
										
# From Rives McDow (1998-10-08):										
# The State of Quintana Roo has reverted back to central STD and DST times										
# (i.e. UTC -0600 and -0500 as of 1998-08-02).										
										
# From Rives McDow (2000-01-10):										
# Effective April 4, 1999 at 2:00 AM local time, Sonora changed to the time										
# zone 5 hours from the International Date Line, and will not observe daylight										
# savings time so as to stay on the same time zone as the southern part of										
# Arizona year round.										
										
# From Jesper Nørgaard, translating										
# <http://www.reforma.com/nacional/articulo/064327/> (2001-01-17):										
# In Oaxaca, the 55.000 teachers from the Section 22 of the National										
# Syndicate of Education Workers, refuse to apply daylight saving each										
# year, so that the more than 10,000 schools work at normal hour the										
# whole year.										
										
# From Gwillim Law (2001-01-19):										
# <http://www.reforma.com/negocios_y_dinero/articulo/064481/> ... says										
# (translated):...										
# January 17, 2000 - The Energy Secretary, Ernesto Martens, announced										
# that Summer Time will be reduced from seven to five months, starting										
# this year....

"# [translated], says ""summer time will ... take effect on the first Sunday"										
# in May, and end on the last Sunday of September.										
										
# From Arthur David Olson (2001-01-25):										
# The 2001-01-24 traditional Washington Post contained the page one										
"# story ""Timely Issue Divides Mexicans.""..."										
# http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37383-2001Jan23.html										
"# ... Mexico City Mayor López Obrador ""...is threatening to keep"										
# Mexico City and its 20 million residents on a different time than										
"# the rest of the country..."" In particular, López Obrador would abolish"										
# observation of Daylight Saving Time.										
										
# Official statute published by the Energy Department										
# http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/decretohorver2001.html#decre										
# (2001-02-01) shows Baja and Chihauhua as still using US DST rules,										
# and Sonora with no DST.  This was reported by Jesper Nørgaard (2001-02-03).										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-03):										
#										
# http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/20010303/t000018766.html										
# James F. Smith writes in today's LA Times										
# * Sonora will continue to observe standard time.										
# * Last week Mexico City's mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador decreed that										
#   the Federal District will not adopt DST.										
# * 4 of 16 district leaders announced they'll ignore the decree.										
# * The decree does not affect federal-controlled facilities including										
#   the airport, banks, hospitals, and schools.										
#										
# For now we'll assume that the Federal District will bow to federal rules.										
										
# From Jesper Nørgaard (2001-04-01):										
# I found some references to the Mexican application of daylight										
# saving, which modifies what I had already sent you, stating earlier										
# that a number of northern Mexican states would go on daylight										
# saving. The modification reverts this to only cover Baja California										
# (Norte), while all other states (except Sonora, who has no daylight										
# saving all year) will follow the original decree of president										
# Vicente Fox, starting daylight saving May 6, 2001 and ending										
# September 30, 2001.

# From Reuters (2001-09-04):										
# Mexico's Supreme Court on Tuesday declared that daylight savings was										
# unconstitutional in Mexico City, creating the possibility the										
# capital will be in a different time zone from the rest of the nation										
# next year....  The Supreme Court's ruling takes effect at 2:00										
# a.m. (0800 GMT) on Sept. 30, when Mexico is scheduled to revert to										
"# standard time. ""This is so residents of the Federal District are not"										
"# subject to unexpected time changes,"" a statement from the court said."										
										
# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2002-03-12):										
# ... consulting my local grocery store(!) and my coworkers, they all insisted										
# that a new decision had been made to reinstate US style DST in Mexico....										
# http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/horaver2001_m1_2002.html (2002-02-20)										
# confirms this.  Sonora as usual is the only state where DST is not applied.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):										
# Formerly there was an America/Ensenada zone, which differed from										
# America/Tijuana only in that it did not observe DST from 1976										
# through 1995.  This was as per Shanks (1999).  But Shanks & Pottenger say										
# Ensenada did not observe DST from 1948 through 1975.  Guy Harris reports										
"# that the 1987 OAG says ""Only Ensenada, Mexicali, San Felipe and"										
"# Tijuana observe DST,"" which agrees with Shanks & Pottenger but implies that"										
# DST-observance was a town-by-town matter back then.  This concerns										
# data after 1970 so most likely there should be at least one Zone										
# other than America/Tijuana for Baja, but it's not clear yet what its										
# name or contents should be.

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-09):										
# I'm in Maryland which is now observing United States Eastern Daylight										
# Time. At 9:44 local time I used RealPlayer to listen to										
# http://media.enet.cu/radioreloj										
# a Cuban information station, and heard										
"# the time announced as ""ocho cuarenta y cuatro"" (""eight forty-four""),"										
# indicating that Cuba is still on standard time.										
										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-12):										
# It seems that Cuba will start DST on Sunday, 2007-03-16...										
# It was announced yesterday, according to this source (in Spanish):										
# http://www.nnc.cubaweb.cu/marzo-2008/cien-1-11-3-08.htm										
#										
# Some more background information is posted here:										
# https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/cuba-starts-dst-march-16.html										
#										
# The article also says that Cuba has been observing DST since 1963,										
# while Shanks (and tzdata) has 1965 as the first date (except in the										
# 1940's). Many other web pages in Cuba also claim that it has been										
# observed since 1963, but with the exception of 1970 - an exception										
# which is not present in tzdata/Shanks. So there is a chance we need to										
# change some historic records as well.										
#										
# One example:										
# http://www.radiohc.cu/espanol/noticias/mar07/11mar/hor.htm										
										
# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-03-13):										
# The Cuban time change has just been confirmed on the most authoritative										
# web site, the Granma.  Please check out										
# http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/2008/03/13/nacional/artic10.html										
#										
# Basically as expected after Steffen Thorsen's information, the change										
# will take place midnight between Saturday and Sunday.										
										
# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-12):										
# Assume Sun>=15 (third Sunday) going forward.										
										
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2009-03-04)										
# According to the Radio Reloj - Cuba will start Daylight Saving Time on										
# midnight between Saturday, March 07, 2009 and Sunday, March 08, 2009-

# From Steffen Thorsen (2011-03-08):

# Haiti										
# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-15):										
# Risto O. Nykänen wrote me that Haiti is now on DST.										
# I searched for confirmation, and I found a press release										
# on the Web page of the Haitian Consulate in Chicago (2005-03-31),										
# <http://www.haitianconsulate.org/time.doc>.  Translated from French, it says:										
#										
"#  ""The Prime Minister's Communication Office notifies the public in general"										
#   and the press in particular that, following a decision of the Interior										
#   Ministry and the Territorial Collectivities [I suppose that means the										
#   provinces], Haiti will move to Eastern Daylight Time in the night from next										
#   Saturday the 2nd to Sunday the 3rd.										
#										
"#  ""Consequently, the Prime Minister's Communication Office wishes to inform"										
#   the population that the country's clocks will be set forward one hour										
#   starting at midnight.  This provision will hold until the last Saturday in										
#   October 2005.										
#										
"#  ""Port-au-Prince, March 31, 2005"""										
#										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-04-04):										
# I have been informed by users that Haiti observes DST this year like										
"# last year, so the current ""only"" rule for 2005 might be changed to a"										
"# ""max"" rule or to last until 2006. (Who knows if they will observe DST"										
# next year or if they will extend their DST like US/Canada next year).										
#										
# I have found this article about it (in French):										
# http://www.haitipressnetwork.com/news.cfm?articleID=7612										
#										
# The reason seems to be an energy crisis.										
										
# From Stephen Colebourne (2007-02-22):										
# Some IATA info: Haiti won't be having DST in 2007.										
										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2012-03-11):										
# According to several news sources, Haiti will observe DST this year,										
# apparently using the same start and end date as USA/Canada.										
# So this means they have already changed their time.										
#										
# http://www.alterpresse.org/spip.php?article12510										
# http://radiovision2000haiti.net/home/?p=13253										
#										
# From Arthur David Olson (2012-03-11):										
# The alterpresse.org source seems to show a US-style leap from 2:00 a.m. to										
# 3:00 a.m. rather than the traditional Haitian jump at midnight.										
# Assume a US-style fall back as well.										
										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-03-10):										
# It appears that Haiti is observing DST this year as well, same rules										
# as US/Canada.  They did it last year as well, and it looks like they										
# are going to observe DST every year now...

# We just checked with our São Paulo office and they say the government of

# So Buenos Aires should be -3 hours from GMT at all times.										
#										
# From Fabián L. Arce Jofré (2000-04-04):										
# The law that claimed DST for Argentina was derogated by President Fernando										
# de la Rúa on March 2, 2000, because it would make people spend more energy										
# in the winter time, rather than less.  The change took effect on March 3.										
#

# (2001-06-25):

# A user (Leonardo Chaim) reported that Argentina will adopt DST....										
# all of the country (all Zone-entries) are affected.  News reports like

# The following eight (8) provinces pulled clocks back to UTC-04:00 at

#										
# Catamarca, Chubut, La Rioja, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Cruz,										
# Tierra del Fuego, Tucumán.										
#										
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-14):										
# ... this weekend, the Province of Tucumán decided it'd go back to UTC-03:00										
# yesterday midnight (that is, at 24:00 Saturday 12th), since the people's										
# annoyance with the change is much higher than the power savings obtained....										
#										
# From Gwillim Law (2004-06-14):										
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/06/10/de_609078.asp ...										
"#     ""The time change in Tierra del Fuego was a conflicted decision from"										
#   the start.  The government had decreed that the measure would take										
#   effect on June 1, but a normative error forced the new time to begin										
#   three days earlier, from a Saturday to a Sunday....										
# Our understanding was that the change was originally scheduled to take place										
# on June 1 at 00:00 in Chubut, Santa Cruz, Tierra del Fuego (and some other										
# provinces).  Sunday was May 30, only two days earlier.  So the article										
# contains a contradiction.  I would give more credence to the Saturday/Sunday										
"# date than the ""three days earlier"" phrase, and conclude that Tierra del"										
# Fuego set its clocks back at 2004-05-30 00:00.										
#										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-05):										
# The previous law 7210 which changed the province of Mendoza's time zone

# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_argentina02.html										
										
# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-01-18):										
# The page of the San Luis provincial government										
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=0&id=22812										
# confirms what Alex Krivenyshev has earlier sent to the tz										
# emailing list about that San Luis plans to return to standard										
# time much earlier than the rest of the country. It also										
# confirms that upon request the provinces San Juan and Mendoza										
# refused to follow San Luis in this change.										
#										
# The change is supposed to take place Monday the 21st at 0:00										
# hours. As far as I understand it if this goes ahead, we need										
# a new timezone for San Luis (although there are also documented										
# independent changes in the southamerica file of San Luis in										
# 1990 and 1991 which has not been confirmed).										
										
# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-01-25):										
# Unfortunately the below page has become defunct, about the San Luis										
"# time change. Perhaps because it now is part of a group of pages ""Most"										
"# important pages of 2008."""										
#										
# You can use										
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/notas.asp?idCanal=8141&id=22834										
"# instead it seems. Or use ""Buscador"" from the main page of the San Luis"										
"# government, and fill in ""huso"" and click OK, and you will get 3 pages"										
# from which the first one is identical to the above.										
										
# From Mariano Absatz (2008-01-28):										
# I can confirm that the Province of San Luis (and so far only that										
# province) decided to go back to UTC-3 effective midnight Jan 20th 2008										
# (that is, Monday 21st at 0:00 is the time the clocks were delayed back										
# 1 hour), and they intend to keep UTC-3 as their timezone all year round										
# (that is, unless they change their mind any minute now).										
#										
# So we'll have to add yet another city to 'southamerica' (I think San										
# Luis city is the mos populated city in the Province, so it'd be										
# America/Argentina/San_Luis... of course I can't remember if San Luis's										
# history of particular changes goes along with Mendoza or San Juan :-(										
# (I only remember not being able to collect hard facts about San Luis										
# back in 2004, when these provinces changed to UTC-4 for a few days, I										
# mailed them personally and never got an answer).										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-12):										
# Unless otherwise specified, data entries are from Shanks & Pottenger through										
# 1992, from the IATA otherwise.  As noted below, Shanks & Pottenger say that										
# America/Cordoba split into 6 subregions during 1991/1992, one of which										
# was America/San_Luis, but we haven't verified this yet so for now we'll										
# keep America/Cordoba a single region rather than splitting it into the										
# other 5 subregions.										
										
# From Mariano Absatz (2009-03-13):										
# Yesterday (with our usual 2-day notice) the Province of San Luis										
"# decided that next Sunday instead of ""staying"" @utc-03:00 they will go"										
# to utc-04:00 until the second Saturday in October...										
#										
# The press release is at										
# http://www.sanluis.gov.ar/SL/Paginas/NoticiaDetalle.asp?TemaId=1&InfoPrensaId=3102										
# (I couldn't find the decree, but www.sanluis.gov.ar										
# is the official page for the Province Government.)										
#										
# There's also a note in only one of the major national papers ...										
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1107912										
#										
# The press release says [quick and dirty translation]:										
# ... announced that next Sunday, at 00:00, Puntanos (the San Luis										
# inhabitants) will have to turn back one hour their clocks										
#										
# Since then, San Luis will establish its own Province timezone. Thus,										
# during 2009, this timezone change will run from 00:00 the third Sunday										
# in March until 24:00 of the second Saturday in October.										
										
# From Mariano Absatz (2009-10-16):										
# ...the Province of San Luis is a case in itself.										
#										
# The Law at										
# http://www.diputadossanluis.gov.ar/diputadosasp/paginas/verNorma.asp?NormaID=276										
# is ambiguous because establishes a calendar from the 2nd Sunday in										
# October at 0:00 thru the 2nd Saturday in March at 24:00 and the										
# complement of that starting on the 2nd Sunday of March at 0:00 and										
# ending on the 2nd Saturday of March at 24:00.										
#										
# This clearly breaks every time the 1st of March or October is a Sunday.										
#										
"# IMHO, the ""spirit of the Law"" is to make the changes at 0:00 on the 2nd"										
# Sunday of October and March.										
#										
# The problem is that the changes in the rest of the Provinces that did										
# change in 2007/2008, were made according to the Federal Law and Decrees										
# that did so on the 3rd Sunday of October and March.										
#										
# In fact, San Luis actually switched from UTC-4 to UTC-3 last Sunday										
# (October 11th) at 0:00.										
#										
"# So I guess a new set of rules, besides ""Arg"", must be made and the last"										
# America/Argentina/San_Luis entries should change to use these...										
# ...										
										
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2010-04-09):										
# According to news reports from El Diario de la República Province San										
# Luis, Argentina (standard time UTC-04) will keep Daylight Saving Time										
# after April 11, 2010 - will continue to have same time as rest of										
# Argentina (UTC-3) (no DST).

# From Mariano Absatz (2010-04-12):										
# yes...I can confirm this...and given that San Luis keeps calling										
"# UTC-03:00 ""summer time"", we should't just let San Luis go back to ""Arg"""										
"# rules...San Luis is still using ""Western ARgentina Time"" and it got"										
# stuck on Summer daylight savings time even though the summer is over.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2013-09-05):										
# Perhaps San Luis operates on the legal fiction that it is at -04										
# with perpetual summer time, but ordinary usage typically seems to										
"# just say it's at -03; see, for example,"										
# https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hora_oficial_argentina										
# We've documented similar situations as being plain changes to										
# standard time, so let's do that here too.  This does not change UTC										
# offsets, only tm_isdst and the time zone abbreviations.  One minor										
# plus is that this silences a zic complaint that there's no POSIX TZ										
# setting for time stamps past 2038.

# Brazil										
										
# From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):										
# The mayor of Rio recently attempted to change the time zone rules										
# just in his city, in order to leave more summer time for the tourist trade.										
"# The rule change lasted only part of the day;"										
# the federal government refused to follow the city's rules, and business										
# was in a chaos, so the mayor backed down that afternoon.										
										
# From IATA SSIM (1996-02):										
# _Only_ the following states in BR1 observe DST: Rio Grande do Sul (RS),										
# Santa Catarina (SC), Paraná (PR), São Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ),										
# Espírito Santo (ES), Minas Gerais (MG), Bahia (BA), Goiás (GO),										
# Distrito Federal (DF), Tocantins (TO), Sergipe [SE] and Alagoas [AL].										
# [The last three states are new to this issue of the IATA SSIM.]										
										
# From Gwillim Law (1996-10-07):										
# Geography, history (Tocantins was part of Goiás until 1989), and other										
# sources of time zone information lead me to believe that AL, SE, and TO were										
# always in BR1, and so the only change was whether or not they observed DST....										
# The earliest issue of the SSIM I have is 2/91.  Each issue from then until										
# 9/95 says that DST is observed only in the ten states I quoted from 9/95,										
# along with Mato Grosso (MT) and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), which are in BR2										
# (UTC-4)....  The other two time zones given for Brazil are BR3, which is										
"# UTC-5, no DST, and applies only in the state of Acre (AC); and BR4, which is"										
# UTC-2, and applies to Fernando de Noronha (formerly FN, but I believe it's										
# become part of the state of Pernambuco).  The boundary between BR1 and BR2										
# has never been clearly stated.  They've simply been called East and West.										
# However, some conclusions can be drawn from another IATA manual: the Airline										
# Coding Directory, which lists close to 400 airports in Brazil.  For each										
# airport it gives a time zone which is coded to the SSIM.  From that										
# information, I'm led to conclude that the states of Amapá (AP), Ceará (CE),										
# Maranhão (MA), Paraíba (PR), Pernambuco (PE), Piauí (PI), and Rio Grande do										
# Norte (RN), and the eastern part of Pará (PA) are all in BR1 without DST.										
										
# From Marcos Tadeu (1998-09-27):										
# Brazilian official page <http://pcdsh01.on.br/verao1.html>										
										
# From Jesper Nørgaard (2000-11-03):										
# [For an official list of which regions in Brazil use which time zones, see:]										
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/Fusbr.htm										
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/Fusbrhv.htm										
										
# From Celso Doria via David Madeo (2002-10-09):										
# The reason for the delay this year has to do with elections in Brazil.										
#										
# Unlike in the United States, elections in Brazil are 100% computerized and										
# the results are known almost immediately.  Yesterday, it was the first										
# round of the elections when 115 million Brazilians voted for President,										
# Governor, Senators, Federal Deputies, and State Deputies.  Nobody is										
# counting (or re-counting) votes anymore and we know there will be a second										
# round for the Presidency and also for some Governors.  The 2nd round will										
# take place on October 27th.										
#										
# The reason why the DST will only begin November 3rd is that the thousands										
# of electoral machines used cannot have their time changed, and since the										
# Constitution says the elections must begin at 8:00 AM and end at 5:00 PM,										
# the Government decided to postpone DST, instead of changing the Constitution										
# (maybe, for the next elections, it will be possible to change the clock)...										
										
# From Rodrigo Severo (2004-10-04):										
# It's just the biannual change made necessary by the much hyped, supposedly										
# modern Brazilian eletronic voting machines which, apparently, can't deal										
# with a time change between the first and the second rounds of the elections.										
										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2007-09-20):										
# Brazil will start DST on 2007-10-14 00:00 and end on 2008-02-17 00:00:										
"# http://www.mme.gov.br/site/news/detail.do;jsessionid=BBA06811AFCAAC28F0285210913513DA?newsId=13975"										
										
# From Paul Schulze (2008-06-24):										
"# ...by law number 11.662 of April 24, 2008 (published in the ""Diario"										
"# Oficial da União""...) in Brazil there are changes in the timezones,"										
# effective today (00:00am at June 24, 2008) as follows:										
#										
# a) The timezone UTC+5 is extinguished, with all the Acre state and the										
# part of the Amazonas state that had this timezone now being put to the										
# timezone UTC+4										
# b) The whole Pará state now is put at timezone UTC+3, instead of just										
# part of it, as was before.										
#										
# This change follows a proposal of senator Tiao Viana of Acre state, that										
# proposed it due to concerns about open television channels displaying										
# programs inappropriate to youths in the states that had the timezone										
# UTC+5 too early in the night. In the occasion, some more corrections										
# were proposed, trying to unify the timezones of any given state. This										
# change modifies timezone rules defined in decree 2.784 of 18 June,										
# 1913.										
										
# From Rodrigo Severo (2008-06-24):										
# Just correcting the URL:										
# https://www.in.gov.br/imprensa/visualiza/index.jsp?jornal=do&secao=1&pagina=1&data=25/04/2008										
#										
# As a result of the above Decree I believe the America/Rio_Branco										
# timezone shall be modified from UTC-5 to UTC-4 and a new timezone shall										
# be created to represent the...west side of the Pará State. I										
# suggest this new timezone be called Santarem as the most										
# important/populated city in the affected area.										
#										
# This new timezone would be the same as the Rio_Branco timezone up to										
# the 2008/06/24 change which would be to UTC-3 instead of UTC-4.										
										
# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-06-24):										
# This is a quick reference page for New and Old Brazil Time Zones map.										
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/brazil-time-new-old.php										
#										
# - 4 time zones replaced by 3 time zones - eliminating time zone UTC-05										
# (state Acre and the part of the Amazonas will be UTC/GMT-04) - western										
# part of Par state is moving to one timezone UTC-03 (from UTC-04).										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-10):										
# The official decrees referenced below are mostly taken from										
# Decretos sobre o Horário de Verão no Brasil.										
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/DecHV.html										
										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-08-29):										
# As announced by the government and many newspapers in Brazil late										
# yesterday, Brazil will start DST on 2008-10-19 (need to change rule) and										
# it will end on 2009-02-15 (current rule for Brazil is fine). Based on										
# past years experience with the elections, there was a good chance that										
# the start was postponed to November, but it did not happen this year.

# Chile										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2015-04-03):										
# Shanks & Pottenger says America/Santiago introduced standard time in										
"# 1890 and rounds its UTC offset to 70W40; guess that in practice this"										
# was the same offset as in 1916-1919.  It also says Pacific/Easter										
"# standardized on 109W22 in 1890; assume this didn't change the clocks."										
#										
# Dates for America/Santiago from 1910 to 2004 are primarily from										
# the following source, cited by Oscar van Vlijmen (2006-10-08):										
# [1] Chile Law										
# http://www.webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/chile.html										
# This contains a copy of this official table:										
# Cambios en la hora oficial de Chile desde 1900 (retrieved 2008-03-30)										
# https://web.archive.org/web/20080330200901/http://www.horaoficial.cl/cambio.htm										
# [1] needs several corrections, though.										
#										
# The first set of corrections is from:										
# [2] History of the Official Time of Chile										
# http://www.horaoficial.cl/ing/horaof_ing.html (retrieved 2012-03-06).  See:										
# https://web.archive.org/web/20120306042032/http://www.horaoficial.cl/ing/horaof_ing.html

# https://web.archive.org/web/20121024234627/http://www.horaoficial.cl/horaof.htm										
# A fancier Spanish version (requiring mouse-clicking) is at:										
# http://www.horaoficial.cl/historia_hora.html										
# Conflicts between [1] and [2] were resolved as follows:										
#										
#  - [1] says the 1910 transition was Jan 1, [2] says Jan 10 and cites										
#    Boletín No. 1, Aviso No. 1 (1910).  Go with [2].										
#										
#  - [1] says SMT was -4:42:45, [2] says Chile's official time from										
#    1916 to 1919 was -4:42:46.3, the meridian of Chile's National										
#    Astronomical Observatory (OAN), then located in what is now										
#    Quinta Normal in Santiago.  Go with [2], rounding it to -4:42:46.										
#										
#  - [1] says the 1918 transition was Sep 1, [2] says Sep 10 and cites										
#    Boletín No. 22, Aviso No. 129/1918 (1918-08-23).  Go with [2].										
#										
"#  - [1] does not give times for transitions; assume they occur"										
#    at midnight mainland time, the current common practice.  However,										
#    go with [2]'s specification of 23:00 for the 1947-05-21 transition.										
#										
# Another correction to [1] is from Jesper Nørgaard Welen, who										
"# wrote (2006-10-08), ""I think that there are some obvious mistakes in"										
# the suggested link from Oscar van Vlijmen,... for instance entry 66										
# says that GMT-4 ended 1990-09-12 while entry 67 only begins GMT-3 at										
# 1990-09-15 (they should have been 1990-09-15 and 1990-09-16										
"# respectively), but anyhow it clears up some doubts too."""										
#										
# Data for Pacific/Easter from 1910 through 1967 come from Shanks &

# The law says to switch to DST at midnight [24:00] on the second SATURDAY										
# of October....  The law is the same for March and October.										
# (1998-09-29):										
# Because of the drought this year, the government decided to go into										
# DST earlier (saturday 9/26 at 24:00). This is a one-time change only ...										
# (unless there's another dry season next year, I guess).										
										
# From Julio I. Pacheco Troncoso (1999-03-18):										
# Because of the same drought, the government decided to end DST later,

# From Germán Poo-Caamaño (2008-03-03):

# As stated in the website of the Chilean Energy Ministry										
# http://www.minenergia.cl/ministerio/noticias/generales/gobierno-anuncia-fechas-de-cambio-de.html										
# The Chilean Government has decided to postpone the entrance into winter time

# Quote from the website communication:										
#										
# 6. For the year 2012, the dates of entry into winter time will be as follows:										
"# a. Saturday April 28, 2012, clocks should go back 60 minutes; that is, at"										
# 23:59:59, instead of passing to 0:00, the time should be adjusted to be 23:00

# 01:00 on September 2.										
										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-02-15):										
# According to several news sources, Chile has extended DST this year,										
# they will end DST later and start DST earlier than planned.  They

# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):										
# For now, assume the pattern holds for the indefinite future.										
"# The decree says transitions occur at 24:00; in practice this appears"

# The above says the Magallanes change expires 2019-05-11 at 24:00,

# Sunday 1 September.										
										
# From Rives McDow (2001-02-13):										
#										
# I have communicated several times with people there, and the last										
# time I had communications that was helpful was in 1998.  Here is										
# what was said then:										
#										
"# ""The general rule was that Stanley used daylight saving and the Camp"										
# did not. However for various reasons many people in the Camp have										
# started to use daylight saving (known locally as 'Stanley Time')										
# There is no rule as to who uses daylight saving - it is a matter of										
# personal choice and so it is impossible to draw a map showing who										
# uses it and who does not. Any list would be out of date as soon as										
# it was produced. This year daylight saving ended on April 18/19th										
# and started again on September 12/13th.  I do not know what the rule										
# is, but can find out if you like.  We do not change at the same time										
"# as UK or Chile."""										
#										
"# I did have in my notes that the rule was ""Second Saturday in Sep at"										
"# 0:00 until third Saturday in Apr at 0:00"".  I think that this does"										
"# not agree in some cases with Shanks; is this true?"										
#										
# Also, there is no mention in the list that some areas in the										
# Falklands do not use DST.  I have found in my communications there										
# that these areas are on the western half of East Falkland and all of										
# West Falkland.  Stanley is the only place that consistently observes										
# DST.  Again, as in other places in the world, the farmers don't like										
# it.  West Falkland is almost entirely sheep farmers.										
#										
# I know one lady there that keeps a list of which farm keeps DST and										
# which doesn't each year.  She runs a shop in Stanley, and says that										
# the list changes each year.  She uses it to communicate to her										
# customers, catching them when they are home for lunch or dinner.										
										
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-05):										
# For now, we'll just record the time in Stanley, since we have no										
# better info.										
										
# From Steffen Thorsen (2011-04-01):										
# The Falkland Islands will not turn back clocks this winter, but stay on										
# daylight saving time.										
#										
# One source:										
# http://www.falklandnews.com/public/story.cfm?get=5914&source=3										
#										
# We have gotten this confirmed by a clerk of the legislative assembly:										
# Normally the clocks revert to Local Mean Time (UTC/GMT -4 hours) on the										
# third Sunday of April at 0200hrs and advance to Summer Time (UTC/GMT -3										
# hours) on the first Sunday of September at 0200hrs.										
#										
# IMPORTANT NOTE: During 2011, on a trial basis, the Falkland Islands										
# will not revert to local mean time, but clocks will remain on Summer										
# time (UTC/GMT - 3 hours) throughout the whole of 2011.  Any long term										
# change to local time following the trial period will be notified.										
#										
# From Andrew Newman (2012-02-24)										
# A letter from Justin McPhee, Chief Executive,										
# Cable & Wireless Falkland Islands (dated 2012-02-22)										
# states...										
#   The current Atlantic/Stanley entry under South America expects the										
#   clocks to go back to standard Falklands Time (FKT) on the 15th April.										
#   The database entry states that in 2011 Stanley was staying on fixed										
#   summer time on a trial basis only.  FIG need to contact IANA and/or										
#   the maintainers of the database to inform them we're adopting										
#   the same policy this year and suggest recommendations for future years.										
#										
# For now we will assume permanent summer time for the Falklands										
# until advised differently (to apply for 2012 and beyond, after the 2011										
# experiment was apparently successful.)

# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-31):										
										
# This file contains data outside the normal scope of the tz database,										
# in that its zones do not differ from normal tz zones after 1970.										
# Links in this file point to zones in this file, superseding links in										
# the file 'backward'.										
										
# Although zones in this file may be of some use for analyzing										
# pre-1970 time stamps, they are less reliable, cover only a tiny										
# sliver of the pre-1970 era, and cannot feasibly be improved to cover										
# most of the era.  Because the zones are out of normal scope for the										
# database, less effort is put into maintaining this file.  Many of										
# the zones were formerly in other source files, but were removed or										
# replaced by links as their data entries were questionable and/or they										
# differed from other zones only in pre-1970 time stamps.										
										
# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:										
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),										
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).										
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.										
										
# This file is not intended to be compiled standalone, as it										
# assumes rules from other files.  In the tz distribution, use										
# 'make PACKRATDATA=backzone zones' to compile and install this file.										
										
# Zones are sorted by zone name.  Each zone is preceded by the										
# name of the country that the zone is in, along with any other										
# commentary and rules associated with the entry.

# Ethiopia										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-31):										
# Like the Swahili of Kenya and Tanzania, many Ethiopians keep a										
"# 12-hour clock starting at our 06:00, so their ""8 o'clock"" is our"										
# 02:00 or 14:00.  Keep this in mind when you ask the time in Amharic.										
#										
# Shanks & Pottenger write that Ethiopia had six narrowly-spaced time										
# zones between 1870 and 1890, that they merged to 38E50 (2:35:20) in										
# 1890, and that they switched to 3:00 on 1936-05-05.  Perhaps 38E50										
# was for Adis Dera.  Quite likely the Shanks data entries are wrong										
# anyway.

#	In the following text, the symbol '#' introduces									
#	a comment, which continues from that symbol until									
#	the end of the line. A plain comment line has a									
#	whitespace character following the comment indicator.									
#	There are also special comment lines defined below.									
#	A special comment will always have a non-whitespace									
#	character in column 2.									
#										
#	A blank line should be ignored.									
#										
#	The following table shows the corrections that must									
#	be applied to compute International Atomic Time (TAI)									
#	from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) values that									
#	are transmitted by almost all time services.									
#										
#	The first column shows an epoch as a number of seconds									
#	since 1 January 1900, 00:00:00 (1900.0 is also used to									
#	indicate the same epoch.) Both of these time stamp formats									
#	ignore the complexities of the time scales that were									
#	used before the current definition of UTC at the start									
#	of 1972. (See note 3 below.)									
#	The second column shows the number of seconds that									
#	must be added to UTC to compute TAI for any timestamp									
#	at or after that epoch. The value on each line is									
#	valid from the indicated initial instant until the									
#	epoch given on the next one or indefinitely into the									
#	future if there is no next line.									
#	(The comment on each line shows the representation of									
#	the corresponding initial epoch in the usual									
#	day-month-year format. The epoch always begins at									
#	00:00:00 UTC on the indicated day. See Note 5 below.)									
#										
#	Important notes:									
#										
#	1. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is often referred to									
#	as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The GMT time scale is no									
#	longer used, and the use of GMT to designate UTC is									
#	discouraged.									
#										
#	2. The UTC time scale is realized by many national									
#	laboratories and timing centers. Each laboratory									
#	identifies its realization with its name: Thus									
#	UTC(NIST), UTC(USNO), etc. The differences among									
#	these different realizations are typically on the									
#	order of a few nanoseconds (i.e., 0.000 000 00x s)									
#	and can be ignored for many purposes. These differences									
#	are tabulated in Circular T, which is published monthly									
#	by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures									
#	(BIPM). See www.bipm.org for more information.									
#										
#	3. The current definition of the relationship between UTC									
#	and TAI dates from 1 January 1972. A number of different									
#	time scales were in use before that epoch, and it can be									
#	quite difficult to compute precise timestamps and time									
#	"intervals in those ""prehistoric"" days. For more information,"									
#	consult:									
#										
#		The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical								
#		Ephemeris.								
#	or									
#		"Terry Quinn, ""The BIPM and the Accurate Measurement"								
#		"of Time,"" Proc. of the IEEE, Vol. 79, pp. 894-905,"								
#		July, 1991.								
#										
#	4. The decision to insert a leap second into UTC is currently									
#	the responsibility of the International Earth Rotation and									
#	Reference Systems Service. (The name was changed from the									
#	International Earth Rotation Service, but the acronym IERS									
#	is still used.)									
#										
#	Leap seconds are announced by the IERS in its Bulletin C.									
#										
#	See www.iers.org for more details.									
#										
#	Every national laboratory and timing center uses the									
#	data from the BIPM and the IERS to construct UTC(lab),									
#	their local realization of UTC.									
#										
#	Although the definition also includes the possibility									
#	"of dropping seconds (""negative"" leap seconds), this has"									
#	never been done and is unlikely to be necessary in the									
#	foreseeable future.									
#										
#	5. If your system keeps time as the number of seconds since									
#	some epoch (e.g., NTP timestamps), then the algorithm for									
#	assigning a UTC time stamp to an event that happens during a positive									
#	leap second is not well defined. The official name of that leap									
#	second is 23:59:60, but there is no way of representing that time									
#	in these systems.									
#	Many systems of this type effectively stop the system clock for									
#	one second during the leap second and use a time that is equivalent									
#	to 23:59:59 UTC twice. For these systems, the corresponding TAI									
#	timestamp would be obtained by advancing to the next entry in the									
#	following table when the time equivalent to 23:59:59 UTC									
#	is used for the second time. Thus the leap second which									
#	occurred on 30 June 1972 at 23:59:59 UTC would have TAI									
#	timestamps computed as follows:									
#										
#	...									
#	30 June 1972 23:59:59 (2287785599, first time):	TAI= UTC + 10 seconds								
#	30 June 1972 23:59:60 (2287785599,second time):	TAI= UTC + 11 seconds								
#	1  July 1972 00:00:00 (2287785600)		TAI= UTC + 11 seconds							
#	...									
#										
#	If your system realizes the leap second by repeating 00:00:00 UTC twice									
#	(this is possible but not usual), then the advance to the next entry									
#	in the table must occur the second time that a time equivalent to									
#	00:00:00 UTC is used. Thus, using the same example as above:									
#										
#	...									
#       30 June 1972 23:59:59 (2287785599):		TAI= UTC + 10 seconds								
#       30 June 1972 23:59:60 (2287785600, first time):	TAI= UTC + 10 seconds									
#       1  July 1972 00:00:00 (2287785600,second time):	TAI= UTC + 11 seconds									
#	...									
#										
#	in both cases the use of timestamps based on TAI produces a smooth									
#	time scale with no discontinuity in the time interval. However,									
#	although the long-term behavior of the time scale is correct in both									
#	methods, the second method is technically not correct because it adds									
#	the extra second to the wrong day.									
#										
#	This complexity would not be needed for negative leap seconds (if they									
#	are ever used). The UTC time would skip 23:59:59 and advance from									
#	23:59:58 to 00:00:00 in that case. The TAI offset would decrease by									
#	1 second at the same instant. This is a much easier situation to deal									
#	with, since the difficulty of unambiguously representing the epoch									
#	during the leap second does not arise.									
#										
#	Some systems implement leap seconds by amortizing the leap second									
#	over the last few minutes of the day. The frequency of the local									
#	clock is decreased (or increased) to realize the positive (or									
#	negative) leap second. This method removes the time step described									
#	above. Although the long-term behavior of the time scale is correct									
#	in this case, this method introduces an error during the adjustment									
#	period both in time and in frequency with respect to the official									
#	definition of UTC.

#	Last Update of leap second values:   8 July 2016									
#										
#	The following line shows this last update date in NTP timestamp									
#	format. This is the date on which the most recent change to									
#	the leap second data was added to the file. This line can									
#	be identified by the unique pair of characters in the first two									
#	columns as shown below.									
#										
#$	3676924800									
#										
#	The NTP timestamps are in units of seconds since the NTP epoch,									
#	which is 1 January 1900, 00:00:00. The Modified Julian Day number									
#	corresponding to the NTP time stamp, X, can be computed as									
#										
#	X/86400 + 15020									
#										
#	where the first term converts seconds to days and the second									
#	term adds the MJD corresponding to the time origin defined above.									
#	The integer portion of the result is the integer MJD for that									
#	day, and any remainder is the time of day, expressed as the									
#	fraction of the day since 0 hours UTC. The conversion from day									
#	fraction to seconds or to hours, minutes, and seconds may involve									
#	rounding or truncation, depending on the method used in the									
#	computation.									
#										
#	The data in this file will be updated periodically as new leap									
#	seconds are announced. In addition to being entered on the line									
#	above, the update time (in NTP format) will be added to the basic									
#	file name leap-seconds to form the name leap-seconds.<NTP TIME>.									
#	In addition, the generic name leap-seconds.list will always point to									
#	the most recent version of the file.									
#										
#	This update procedure will be performed only when a new leap second									
#	is announced.									
#										
#	The following entry specifies the expiration date of the data									
#	in this file in units of seconds since the origin at the instant									
#	1 January 1900, 00:00:00. This expiration date will be changed									
#	at least twice per year whether or not a new leap second is									
#	announced. These semi-annual changes will be made no later									
#	than 1 June and 1 December of each year to indicate what									
#	action (if any) is to be taken on 30 June and 31 December,									
#	respectively. (These are the customary effective dates for new									
#	leap seconds.) This expiration date will be identified by a									
#	unique pair of characters in columns 1 and 2 as shown below.									
#	In the unlikely event that a leap second is announced with an									
#	effective date other than 30 June or 31 December, then this									
#	file will be edited to include that leap second as soon as it is									
#	announced or at least one month before the effective date									
#	(whichever is later).									
#	If an announcement by the IERS specifies that no leap second is									
#	scheduled, then only the expiration date of the file will									
#	be advanced to show that the information in the file is still									
#	current -- the update time stamp, the data and the name of the file									
#	will not change.									
#										
#	Updated through IERS Bulletin C54

# This file is in the public domain.										
#										
# From Paul Eggert (2017-10-01):										
# This file contains a table where each row stands for a zone where										
# civil time stamps have agreed since 1970.  Columns are separated by										
# a single tab.  Lines beginning with '#' are comments.  All text uses										
# UTF-8 encoding.  The columns of the table are as follows:										
#										
# 1.  The countries that overlap the zone, as a comma-separated list										
#     of ISO 3166 2-character country codes.  See the file 'iso3166.tab'.										
# 2.  Latitude and longitude of the zone's principal location										
#     in ISO 6709 sign-degrees-minutes-seconds format,										
#     either +-DDMM+-DDDMM or +-DDMMSS+-DDDMMSS,										
#     first latitude (+ is north), then longitude (+ is east).										
# 3.  Zone name used in value of TZ environment variable.										
#     Please see the theory.html file for how zone names are chosen.										
#     If multiple zones overlap a country, each has a row in the										
#     table, with each column 1 containing the country code.										
"# 4.  Comments; present if and only if a country has multiple zones."										
#										
# If a zone covers multiple countries, the most-populous city is used,										
"# and that country is listed first in column 1; any other countries"										
# are listed alphabetically by country code.  The table is sorted										
# first by country code, then (if possible) by an order within the										
# country that (1) makes some geographical sense, and (2) puts the										
# most populous zones first, where that does not contradict (1).										
#										
# This table is intended as an aid for users, to help them select time										
# zone data entries appropriate for their practical needs.  It is not										
# intended to take or endorse any position on legal or territorial claims.

#										
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-31):										
# This file is intended as a backward-compatibility aid for older programs.										
# New programs should use zone1970.tab.  This file is like zone1970.tab (see										
# zone1970.tab's comments), but with the following additional restrictions:										
#										
# 1.  This file contains only ASCII characters.										
# 2.  The first data column contains exactly one country code.										
#										
# Because of (2), each row stands for an area that is the intersection										
# of a region identified by a country code and of a zone where civil										
"# clocks have agreed since 1970; this is a narrower definition than"										
# that of zone1970.tab.										
#										
# This table is intended as an aid for users, to help them select time										
# zone data entries appropriate for their practical needs.  It is not										
# intended to take or endorse any position on legal or territorial claims.
